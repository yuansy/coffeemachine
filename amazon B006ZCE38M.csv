We had our first Hamilton Beach Flex Brew for 11 months before it started leaking water out of the holding tank. Luckily we were still covered under the limited 1 year warranty and received a replacement machine. Had I done more research I would have learned that the water holding tank (for the carafe side) leaking water is a common issue that Hamilton Beach has not resolved. While the Flex Brew makes a decent cup of coffee, when using the 'Bold' option  it is not worth the investment. Our replacement Flex Brew lasted us a mere 5 months before it too started leaking water out of the holding tank. While we routinely clean out the coffee machine in order to avoid any scaling and build up, this is simply a design flaw and is only a matter of time before your machine will leak water all over you counters.

43,Hamilton Beach,"January 19, 2019","Hamilton Beach (49976) FlexBrew Coffee Maker, Single Serve & Full Coffee Pot, Compatible with Single-Serve Pods or Ground Coffee, Programmable, Black",B06Y2WCHDV,4,"We got this because we drink quite a bit of coffee and almost always make full pots on the weekend. Up until now we had to have both the Keurig and the Mr. Coffee on the counter and it just took up a lot of space. When the 15 year old Mr. Coffee finally died we decided to try and consolidate a bit. The consolidation is great. This pot is not all that much smaller than the combination of the previous two but being one unit it looks less cluttered and opens an outlet back up. The Coffee pot in fine. It does what it needs to do and its about the same speed as the one that failed. I don't think the coffee tastes quite as good as before but I am almost sure that is just because this is new and not 'well seasoned' like the Mr. Coffee was. The controls are big, intuitive, and easy to program. Setting the timer on this pot is way better than before. The carafe is a bit of a downgrade. Its glass but has a plastic rim with a bit of a lip on the inside. That will make cleaning inside much more difficult than the previous pot that had no lip. I am not real concerned about it since I think the coffee film makes it better (the wife disagrees... heheh) but if you insist on a clean pot this could be an issue for you. The single serve side is very comparable to the K-15 mini which is what I had before. Its a single cup reservoir so there is no tank to store water. Whatever you pour in is what comes out. That is how you control cup size. Again for me this is very much what I was used to and its fine as I don't use the K-Cups nearly as much as the pot. If you are expecting this to replace a bigger Keurig you would be disappointed. I had hoped the speed at which it makes a K-Cup would be faster than the K-15 but it is not. It might even be a little slower but, once again it suits my needs. As far as overall build quality it seems nice. I have only had it a week or so but nothing feels poorly made. I don't think this thing is going to last 15 years like my last one but if I get 5 I will be happy. Overall so far so good but take note of the speed of the K-Cup maker and the other details before buying.",So far so good but take note of the speed of the K-Cup maker other details before buying.,Amazon,1

She wanted a coffee maker she could use when she had guests but also when she needed to make her morning coffee before work without having to make a whole pot (she dislikes keurigs). When I found this, i thought it would be perfect because it has the best of both worlds and It doesn’t seem very big. Fast forward to Christmas Day, she opens it puts it on her counter and it’s perfect. Doesn’t take up much room. We test it out and are immediately disappointed. We made a full pot for the family and it took about 25 mins to make. Then we tried the single cup side and that took about 10. I thought, maybe because it’s new and the water needs to warm up, etc etc. Well, two weeks later, my mom calls me and she hates the thing. It still takes just as long and the water would constantly back up and end up spilling all over the counter. I ended up sending it back. I for sure didn’t expect it to make coffee in under two minutes (like a keurig) but i also didn’t expect to have to wait almost 30 mins for a full pot and 10 mins for a single cup.

I do not like how once you make a full pot, and you decide to switch to the K-Cup, the warmer shuts off for the pot. I find this most annoying at my hunting camp. Someone will wake up at 4AM to put the pot on, and when I awake around 5 AM, I want my specific Dark Roast blend, and when I switch it to a Single Serve, the pot reduces in Temp, and you cannot just re-switch it back to keep warm. It is great that you can use your own grounds in the provided K-Cup re-use insert, or use store bought ones.

It is exactly what I needed - the flexibility of both a 12 cup pot of coffee and a single serve all in one.  Less counter space, etc.  The 12 cup pot is great.  The single serve is a mess.  The directions say to put a paper clip in a hole, but unless you do it every time, there is no guarantee it will work.  it is like a game of Russian Roulette as to whether you'll get a cup of coffee or a cup full of grounds.  I have wasted so many k-cups that have exploded I lost count.  I have to keep a strainer next to the pot to strain the coffee grounds out.  I wish Keurig would create this item, as it seems the more expensive Cuisanart does the same thing.

We were looking for a coffee maker to replace our Keurig 2.0 (which broke), and were excited about the idea of a machine that could brew both. While the regular coffee part of this machine is fine, the K-Cup side is very frustrating when you've gotten used to a Keurig: 1)Despite what it says on the box, there isn't a 'reservoir'. The K-Cup side works like a regular coffee machine - you pour in the water when you brew, and whatever you put in all comes out. Want to make 10 oz of coffee? Pour in 10oz of water. This is less convienient than a Keurig, but isn't a deal breaker: the problem is though that: 2)One of the huge Keurig convieniences is the speed; this happens because it keeps the water in the internal resevoir hot. Since this machine really doesn't have that, it needs to heat the water up every time. This means it takes 5-6 minutes to make a K-cup, similar to brewing a small pot of coffee. This turned out to be a deal breaker in our family - if a few people are waiting to make coffee, the line at the machine is long! 3)If you have a pot of coffee on the warmer and someone wants to use the k-cup feature, the warmer turns off; so the pot of coffee I made starts getting cold the first time a kid makes theirs on the k-cup side. If you just occasionally want to make coffee via K Cup and usually make it in the pot, this may be a winner, but if you want both all the time, either get 2 machines or another brand combo brewer!",Not a replacement for a Keurig,Amazon,1

We purchased the version with the metal carafe, which it turns out is vacuum insulated, so external heat sources are meaningless, and the freshly brewed coffee is warm, but far from hot, resulting in a weak tasting brew.

It's advertised to keep the coffee hot once brewed:  it does not.  I fill the carafe with hot water and set it aside while I go about preparing the grounds, etc.  I also fill my coffee cup with hot water.  Once brewed the coffee is sort of hot, but not hot-hot.  After pouring the second cup each succeeding cup is cooler than the last one.  Also there is a design flaw in the carafe.  It does not pour easily.  After pouring the first and second cup (carefully) the remaining cups can only be poured without making a mess only if I take the lid off.

Enter the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. There are many, many positives to this machine: the coffee maker side produces hot, fresh coffee that stays hot in the carafe for HOURS.  If you're feeling really fancy, pre-heat it with some hot water to 'prime' it just before brewing.  That way, you can take the carafe with you into the living room and you and a guest can enjoy some fine coffee while partaking of pleasant conversation in overstuffed chairs--just like at those expensive boutique coffee houses.  Additionally, you'll enjoy the relaxation brought about by not having a pretentious grad student in a black turtle neck looking down his nose at you when you request a refill. On the other side is the pod brewer, which in itself is worth the price of admission.  Again, the coffee is hot and fresh-tasting.  The variety of pods available for this unit is truly astounding, allowing you to experience many different flavors in an instant.  I say 'in an instant,' and that's pretty accurate for the speed of brewing with the pod brewer.  It really is an extraordinary time in which we live--if you're a coffee lover, anyway. Like any coffee maker, you get out of this what you put into it: that is, use fresh, filtered water, quality coffee and clean it once in a while.  For the standard brewer, a filtered water/vinegar cocktail run through the brew cycle (followed by a plain water rinse brew) will keep the innards free from the mineral build-up which degrades the coffee making experience.  Likewise, you need to clean the pod brewer, and for that I recommend one of the cleaning kits offered here on Amazon. My mother has used this regularly for a number of months and there has not been one single issue.  In fact, it has been a source of delight, and she's still tickled by the ability to get a fresh cup of coffee on demand.  She brags about her little 'coffee shop' to anyone who'll listen.  It's so cute.","My Mom LOVES Her Little ""Coffee Shop""!!!",Amazon,0

Pot side is not hot when it’s brewed, does “warm up” sitting on the hot pad which affects the flavor I think Flavor is off on the pot side, it’s kind of a burnt, cooked, plastic taste If you have a pot made and want to make a single serve, the heating pad turns off on the pot side.

I always have to use the microwave to get the coffee hot.  This is not what I expected.  I read in the manual one should fill the carafe with hot water first for a minute or so to warm it up.

The K-cup side holds a small amount of water and if it is filled above the fill line it continues to pour until all the water is gone. We tried it with an 8oz cup.

I really like the gold setting but they both seem to work well. - the filter basket is easy to clean - the coffee stays hot for a long time without making it bitter 2) The 'keurig' type feature is very good quality. It does take a minute to brew so again, if you're in a huge hurry you won't like that aspect.

We love our current Cuisinart, but it's going on 5 years and showing signs of age. My main concern was that the HB stated it brewed ten cups, but we are not heavy coffee drinkers, each having 2 mugs per morning. I even measured out the mugs we use to be sure. They hold 2 cups each. So if we drink 4 mugs between us, a 10-cup coffee maker should be about right. Unfortunately, HB measures cups differently. This make doesn't brew 10 cups as it says, but only 6.5.  I suppose they justify they fuzzy math by thinking a 'cup' is one of those dainty porcelain models the 'pinkies-up' crowd uses for high tea. We prefer a full mug times two each morning. Other issues include a single-brew option that boiled all over the counter on its second use, and a keep-warm option that the instructions don't tell you how to turn on. The pot we brewed was a very tasty cup of joe, though. But we need a  brand that doesn't redefine what a 'cup' is.",When is a cup not a cup?,Amazon,1

My husband drinks a full pot of coffee per day, whereas I prefer 1 cup, but having 2 machines really took up a lot of counter space, so when the Mr. Coffee maker stopped working, I began my research for a better option.  The Hamilton Beach Flex Brew is perfect for us.  The benefits of this machine are: full pot and single serve in a  space saving machine versus 2 seperate machines, large opening for pouring water into the reservoirs, water display window easy to read, very handy storage for single serve filters and easy to remove for taller cups, can use regular coffee in single serve with provided filter or can use Keurig pods, and it is easy to remove pods after using without burning fingers, also, the coffee brews hotter than my old coffee pot.  One of the best things about this machine is that it uses all of the water put in the reservoirs, so no water remains which may allow mold or bacteria to build up as is the concern with other single serve coffee makers with large water reservoirs.  The only thing that is missing from this machine is a thermal coffee pot, however that would probably lessen the amount of cups from 12 to 10, and we really like the ability to make 12 when needed, so we have a separate thermal pot  to use as needed.

I mean - who engineers and designs a coffeemaker with the labels ON the buttons knowing full well that people's hands will be moist from water and such (it IS a kitchen appliance) and then using an ink that wipes off??  The print is almost totally gone on that one button.  Yes, it is the one that gets used the most but its only been 3 months.

Worked well for both carafe brew and Keurig, even reasonably easy to keep clean.  Easy to work with and set for timed brew.  Worked great for almost a year.  Last week, started finding a puddle on the counter in the morning after it brewed, discovered it was leaking from the rear, just the carafe site affected.  Researching, You Tube has a fix for this apparently common problem with involves taking the unit apart and more firmly clamping a hose to a connection inside.  Damn.  You'd think Hamilton Beach would be aware and have fixed this by now. Update--I wrote to Amazon and 3rd party retailer to see if they would take the unit back.  They would not.  So I watched several of the You Tube videos, determined that I could probably fix this, and found it to be quite easy after removing the bottom, which has goofy security screw heads which can be removed with a small regular blade screwdriver.  Then the sides pop off and you can see the innards.  Most common problem is the main water feed tube is not secured well with the clamp fitting it's installed with, and comes off.  Took me less than 20 min to disassemble, repair, and re-assemble the unit.  Works fine, no leaks.","Started leaking after a year--common problem with unit, see You Tube",Amazon,0

My dad uses it to make his coffee every morning, he makes it at night and programs it to start at 7 am each morning. My mom uses the K-Cup side to make her hot chocolate. There haven't been any issues with it, it's been a workhorse for them. It is a larger unit, which is to be expected since it's a 2 in 1. You definitely need to think of what counter space you have available before making the commitment to this one. It's great that it comes with the reusable k cup in case you want to make a single cup of whatever your preferred coffee is, or if you want to save money on the expensive k-cups. Like I mentioned, it's digital so it's programmable and has an auto shut off feature. From what I understand about, if you're wanting to make a k-cup and the coffee pot is on you have to switch modes over to the single serve function which turns off the hot plate on the coffee. Not a HUGE deal I guess, if you just have a couple of people at home and the person will remember to switch back to the hot plate mode after their cup is done brewing, but might be obnoxious in a larger family or office setting where someone doesn't switch it back and the pot gets cold. This is the only con for me. Overall I think it's a great buy. You basically get two machines in 1 for less than the cost of the one name brand single serve coffee machine.

Originally I wanted something that would grind the beans and immediately brew it (after the research I found out that was the best way for great tasting coffee). This was my settlement- because frankly I wasn’t about to drop $500 on a coffee maker.. so I bought this guy and a hand held grinder (that thing was maybe $25). I’m over the moon happy with my purchase!! My husband likes it easy, he just wants to pop in a k-cup and go (**make sure to only add the amount of water you want for that particular cup on the single serve side**) I can grind up my coffee on my slow mornings and enjoy it either single cup or a full pot and still can grind up the whole beans if I want to or keep it quick and easy with ground coffee. This thing is definitely for people who need a little variety or “flex” in their coffee making habits- or just want to have the capability to make great coffee and not have to spend too much, this is your next coffee maker. Last notes- I LOVE that I can clean everything that gets coffee on it.

Its almost as if something is wrong with the flow rate or something along those lines. The brew cycle is WAY too fast, so much so, the coffee comes out 80% water 20% actual coffee. Its completely undrinkable it is so diluted. I've read reviews on this that, that has happened on the single serve side but it also does it on the carafe side as well. I use purified water and cleaned all parts after use, each time. It was very well taken care of so this really came as a surprise...obviously there is some sort of flaw with this model. I also attempted to contact Hamilton Beach and they will not return any sort of message, overall annoyed I wasted so much money on a piece of junk and the customer service is horrible. I will never buy another Hamilton Beach item again and I highly recommend you don't either!",Broke After 3 Months!,Amazon,0

Unfortunately, at 11 months old it has starting leaking from the bottom of the coffee maker. It started as just a small leak, and now I am getting enough water to completely soak a dishtowel. I checked online and it seems this is a common issue with this coffee pot. If I left the pot up I can see water dripping from the screws underneath. I will be looking into if it is the tubing or a gasket near the heating element. This is a real disappointment because up until now the coffee maker was an easy 5 stars for me.

We more frequently use the single-cup feature, but within a month or two, we were getting the 'needle' error frequently. At first, simply cleaning out the needle worked, problem solved. But about a month ago, that no longer did the trick. Now when I try to brew a single cup, it starts going (you can hear it gurgling) but ultimately stops, flashes, and resets. It won't yield any liquid. I contacted Hamilton-Beach customer service and, to their credit, they have responded (finally). But their solution thus far is to complete a cleaning cycle (which, as I mentioned, is moot because the machine won't yield any liquid).

The manual says ' if the coffee pod bursts open, try a different brand' ...whatttttt?? Clearly, they knew this to be a problem. It is sooooooo annoying to get a mouth full of grounds. I have a very small mesh strainer that fits over my cup (with some propping up and engineering strategies) that catches the said grounds, but really?? This really seems to be a design flaw. If it weren't for this flaw, I truly would give this a 5 star rating. We are not fancy coffee connoisseurs.. just give me my cup in the morning, so that I can speak to my children and I'm fine!

It was used daily to make tea with the carafe and probably made about 5-6 servings of coffee with either k-cups or the accessory to allow you to use coffee grounds. Everything worked perfect and had very hot coffee until one day we were making tea in the carafe and water started leaking out from the unit. It was clear hot water that is coming from under the unit. The first time it was about 2 cups, then it went to about 4 cups the second time we tried. It continues to leak. My last coffee pot lasted us for about 7 years and the only reason we replaced it was the element was getting weak and not making as hot of water, but it was still working and not leaking out water everywhere. I looked at the warranty (1 year) and I have to pay the cost to ship it to them and back (LOL). So for an item that costs $50 I'm going to pay $30 round trip to get an item fixed that only lasted me 4 1/2 months? I think I will move a different direction. I will contact the manufacturer, but don't think I will get anywhere with a replacement for their defective item. If they do come through I will update this review. *edit* They did honor this under warranty. It took them about 2 months to respond, but once I was notified they would replace the item, it arrived in about 14 days. We will see how long this one lasts, but I am glad they replaced it!

I’m glad I did. It looks nicer than the old version and it works better. The coffee tastes great. To respond to some of the negative reviews here, I’ll state that yes, if you’re using a single-serve pod, it is slower than a Keurig. You know why? Because it’s not a Keurig. If you can’t wait an extra minute for your coffee, I think you might have a problem. Just like the previous version, there is an issue with the nozzle clogging, so you may have to poke it periodically to clear it. Just like you do with a Keurig. Do yourself a favor. If you buy this coffee maker, spring for the 3- or 4-year extended warranty. It costs next to nothing. When the machine breaks, and it eventually will, you ship the unit back to the warranty company on their dime (as long as the 1-year manufacturer’s warranty has expired) and you get back all the money you paid for it.

We measure the same amount of water, same amount of coffee and select the same brew strength and still cannot get two good cups in a row.  There is no standing reservoir of heated water, so you wait several minutes for the heating element to get the water up to temperature. It just seems to struggle with this basic requirement. The single serve side has no set volume, so it dispenses every drop of water you place in it. There is a gauge on the side of the machine, but a delay in the water finding it's level.  Pour too quickly and end up with too much water? Too bad, the only way to get it out is to brew it, so you have to wait while the machine pushes through the water and then start over. The measuring marks are not lit and are hard to see.  We keep an actual measuring cup next to the machine for accuracy which is annoying because it clutters the counter. We've tried pods for consistency and still don't get the same result when brewing cups back to back. The large pot option: We like a stronger brew, but the basket won't hold enough coffee for a full 12 cup pot.  We have to brew fewer cups or we end up with grounds and coffee washing over the top of the filter and then down into your pot. The concept seems useful. The execution is dismal. Move on to another machine.",Horribly inconsistent coffee and bad design.,Amazon,2

My husband did some research and determined that this is a common problem with this model.  Initially I was impressed with Hamilton Beach customer service. They offered to replace the coffee maker with a new one. We had to cut the cord of the current coffee maker and send them a picture. We only had to pay $7 for shipping a new one.  Two months later, Hamilton Beach is now telling us they never received a photo and they are no longer able/willing to send us a new one.

The coffee maker is easy to program, has a nice, clear, screen with the setting and time, and the thermal carafe keeps the coffee warm. I did, however, drop the top to the carafe when I took it out of the box and the top cracked. The drop wasn't a high drop, so I question the durability. The break luckily doesn't affect the function of the the maker or carafe. The biggest issue I have is with the single serve 'K-cup' maker. The instructions say to make sure the reservoir is empty after every use, so unlike a Keurig, it cannot store water for future use, and the reservoir only has a 14oz capacity, anyway.  I find it very inconvenient. The lid that covers the reservoir is at an odd angle and I have to pull the machine all the way out from under my cupboards to use it.  One of my regular sized coffee cups is 10oz, which I had to measure so I could know the exact amount of water to add every time. Having to measure out 10 oz of water every time I want to use the single serve side is very irritating and therefore it doesn't get used very often. Also, if you use hot chocolate cups, it requires a plain water cycle after every use to clean the nozzle. I don't know if that is standard, but to make one cup of something, in a way that is supposed to be convenient, it's not convenient at all. I would stick with a regular coffee maker and buy a separate pod coffee maker.","It's nice to have a two in one, but...",Amazon,0

We love the space saving design of having a carafe brewer and k-cup brewer all in one unit, and the design works perfectly for our family's vastly different morning schedules. We use both sides of the unit pretty much daily. The first one we had broke after about 8 months. Okay, we loved it and figured maybe we'd just gotten a bum unit, so we bought another one of the newer model. This one worked for about 11 months before it developed a small leak under the unit from the carafe side. No problem, we just stuck a dish towel under it for brewing. The leak got worse, the towel started ending up soaked after each brew. Then today when we tried to brew our morning pot of coffee the entire contents of the reservoir leaked onto the counter, not a drop ended up going through the coffee and filter. Note that the k-cup side does still work fine, though. So that's two units broken in the span of about 18 months. We love the functionality so much that I can't bring myself to replace it with two separate brewers, but I also don't want to pay more than twice as much for a different brand that does the same general thing. So even with the two breakages, we are considering buying a third and just resigning ourselves to the fact that it will break in a year or less too. Which is ridiculous because there are people I know still using a regular cheap coffee maker that they've had since college more than 20 years ago. I guess you get what you pay for, but I'd be willing to pay a little more for something with actual quality control and the durability to get at least 2 years out of it.","Perfect functionality, terrible quality",Amazon,0

When it worked, we enjoyed the ability to make either a full pot or a single pot. It was easy to use although I wish you could have kept the carafe heat plate on while brewing a single cup at the same time. The single cup has a nice feature where you can use coffee grounds or Kcups. But all the good things were irrelevant once it started leaking. I've never had a coffee pot do this and since then, I've read that it happened to other people too. The manufacture replaced the item but it took some work on my end. First, I had to email them because the number Amazon has for them didn't work. I received a return email that told me the product was under warranty so it could be replaced. I had to call a number in the email and pay $11.49 for shipping. I also had to cut the cord on the coffee maker and email them a picture of it. Once I did everything they asked, they sent me a replacement within 2 weeks. I was annoyed with having to pay to replace a product that had a dangerous malfunction but I didn't want to waste the $82 I had already spent either. So unless you want to risk this coffee maker breaking on you in the next year and having to pay to replace it (and hope that one doesn't leak), I would invest your money in a better one to begin with.",Leaks Water Everywhere!

I have been having problems with the kcups 'exploding' and putting water and coffee grounds all over my counter and in the coffee cup.  This is not acceptable performance from the device.  I note that this happens with plastic kcups from all vendors.  I have not had any problems with the Betterbrew Eco Coffee Pods which have no plastic grounds container to be punctured. I have done some analysis and I note that the needle that is used to puncture the bottom of the kcup is also used to channel the brewed coffee into the cup thru the top of the needle.  I believe that flap on the hole in the bottom of the kcup is getting warm and flexible as the coffee is brewing and eventually flaps down over the hole in the top of the needle, plugging the outlet.  With no outlet, the kcup then 'explodes' putting hot water and coffee grounds all over the place. May I suggest that a solution might be to design the bottom needle similar to the top needle?  In this fashion, the top of the needle is solid and the coffee flows through an opening on the side of the needle. With this design, if the punctured part of the kcup flaps down when it is heated it will not obstruct the outlet for the coffee into the cup and 'explosions' should be eliminated.

The problem is, this advertises that it brews k-cups but DOES NOT BREW KEURIG CUPS. The company rep said 'their foil is too strong'. I found this out after exploding four cups in a row - I thought the first was a fluke, and found out that the machine's failure to brew a cup of coffee with a Keurig k-cup was, apparently a design feature. The rep said the machine will brew 'Dunkin Donuts' but does not work with any of the k-cups made by Keurig - their brand, Coffee House, Glorias or whatever-else-they-bought. The conventional 12-cup brewer worked wonderfully but, as a versatile machine, this product fell short.

My now-ex and I had an earlier version of this Hamilton Beach coffeemaker some years ago, and I really loved it.  The single serve side of that older version did not accept K-cups, just regular ground coffee.  I also know that coffeemaker is about 8 years old and still works just fine, so I decided to just get another one of those.  However, while I was looking for it on Amazon, I found this one instead.  While I didn't want a Keurig, I liked the idea of having the *option* of using K-cups so I could occasionally try out some of the fun flavors available for them. I ended up not ordering this from Amazon, but buying at a local store.  But I still wanted to leave this review, because I really love this machine.  Everything about it has worked great.  There's not much to say about the carafe side, it's just like any standard coffee maker, simple.  Takes regular coffee filters (not cones).  Works fine. I use the single serve side far more often, and I *love* it.  I've used it both with my own ground coffee, and with K-cups.  There is a plastic mini filter with a tight mesh in it for ground coffee, meaning you don't need a separate filter (tho the instructions say if you want to add a disposable paper filter to the filter basket, you can use #1 cone filters - but you definitely do not need to).  If you want to make a K-cup, you just lift the mini filter basket out and drop in the K-cup unit instead, then pop your K-cup in and shut the lid.  It's very simple and easy to do. Both methods have worked great for me, I've had zero problems with it.  I have not once had coffee grounds in my cup.  I don't find it particularly slow in brewing, in fact it's faster than some coffee pots I've used, otherwise I'd say fairly average.  The coffee comes out quite hot, which I personally prefer because I put milk in mine, which puts it at the perfect temperature. One reviewer said something about the machine having a nasty plastic smell or taste that they couldn't get rid of.  I just wanted to say I never had that problem.  First pots/cups of coffee from both sides were delicious. Some reviewers said their coffeemaker worked great for a period of time, then started leaking or otherwise not working.  Since I just got mine, I can't speak to that, but as I mentioned at the beginning, I specifically wanted this one because we had an earlier version by the same company, and it's 8 years old and still working perfectly.  If Hamilton Beach has since cut corners to cut costs, and this ends up being a piece of junk, I'll definitely update this review. So I'm really thrilled with this and would definitely recommend it.",My Favorite Coffeemaker,Amazon,0

I have been a coffee drinker for about 50 years, so I have had numerous coffee pots. My last coffee pot was a Cuisinart. Very expensive, but it was still working when I passed it on to my nephew after using every day for at  least 6 years. I decided to replace it with a pot that I could put a k-cup in and be on the go, or brew a pot on the mornings when I am staying home. I trust the Cuisinart name, but decided on the Hamilton Beach after reading reviews for days and considering the difference in price. I do not share my reviews of a product until I have used it for several months so I give the product a fair try. I have had no problems with water leakage and I fill the water to the max level each time.  I did have two times when the k-pod broke open and gave me a lot of grounds, but one of the times it was an off-brand k-cup and the other time I believe that opened the top to make sure that I inserted the k-cup and perhaps the hole in the k-cup was enlarged a bit and let grounds out. I have now brewed about 75 pots of coffee and run through at least 75 pods. No more incidents - just wonderful coffee! I clean the regular carafe part with white vinegar every couple of months. I only use distilled or reverse osmosis water in the k-cup part to avoid problems with the needle getting clogged. I wipe the needle off ever few brewing as well. I like the feature of being able to switch from regular to bold brew. A message comes up if you forget to put the water in or do not close the k-cup top tightly. The only negative thing for me - which may not matter to most people - is that the burner shuts off after 2 hours of keeping warm. I was spoiled with my old pot having an adjustable setting for up to 4 hours.",Great Machine,Amazon,0

It will use whatever you put into the bin so make sure you don't put more in there than your cup can hold! That said, the flex brew is nice, the ability to do k-cups, single cup grounds or a carafe is great. Take a tip from the manual, though, and run hot water through the carafe before using it so it's heated up already and won't suck the heat out of your coffee. There is a heater under the carafe but it's hard to say how much good it does when the carafe itself is insulated. That said, the insulated carafe is pretty amazing and keeps the coffee piping hot even after 4 hours. (Note: take the advice from the manual and swirl some hot water around in the carafe before you use it, to pre-heat it. Definitely helps, especially if you're only making a small amount.) Making a single cup with grounds is nice and easy and no paper filter is required. It comes with a plastic+mesh filter you insert into the kcup slot. Works great. I don't recommend this for, say, a waiting room for customer use, however, as the device is not overly intuitive.

The little spring loaded device that allows the coffee to flow into the carafe gets plugged up with coffee grounds and will not allow the coffee to flow into the carafe until the carafe is removed.  After the Carafe is removed the spring loaded device that stops the coffee when you want to pour a cup before it is finished brewing, won't work properly because of the grounds that have plugged it up.

Pot & K-cup: A few days in between needing a whole pot I have used K-cups and it punctures the k-cup every time. I have made almost 50 pots of coffee and nearly 3 dozen k-cups. Maintenance & Cleaning: The device has been very easy to clean on all parts. Also, the clever built-in storage for the K-cup and small single brew side is great. 5/5 Stars: I will continue to and have recommended this coffee maker to many people.

Doesn't matter which brands of k-cups I use...although some seem to be worse than others. Making sure that the lower penetrating 'needle' (located inside the k-cup holder) is clear of any grounds helps. If you can't see through it just run a toothpick down it to clean it out. The original Keurigs don't have this problem - at least not whenever I've used them at other people's homes. Went with this purchase because of the dual traditional pot. Turns out we really never use it. Keurig or this - we've decided we don't like using all of the plastic used in k-cups.

I followed the directions to insure all parts were clean a and free of debris; especially coffee grounds which can clog up small water pathways. Everything was cleaned many times.  Occasionally, I would get lucky and the k-cup would brew as expected.  Then for no apparent reason, it would blow up again.

After reading other reviews, I decided to go with the 49976 model. I’m at about 2 months of use and am still happy with it. It is definitely larger than a regular coffee maker but it’s smaller than a coffee maker and a Kcup maker sitting side by side. Both the regular and the Kcup brewers work very well and the coffee is much better than my old (Mr Coffee) maker. Two minor complaints that don’t really affect how I would rate this but some people might be interested 1) the regular singles serve brew cup fits under the base of the single serve side but it has to be put in a very specific way or the base won’t close. Not a problem once you figure out the correct way, but don’t try to learn before you’ve had your first cup of coffee in the morning. 2) The coffee carafe has an anti spill piece of plastic which is nice to keep the coffee from overflowing the lip, but it kind of makes it difficult to rinse out with soapy water too.

I will try giving a fair review by listing the pros and cons. PROS 1) the flexibility to brew either a pot or a single cup 2) the ability to program an automatic brew time for a full pot 3) easily removed parts and accessories 4) the option of choosing the strength of the brew (regular or bold) 5) a better tasting cup of coffee (of course this is just my opinion) 6) less expensive than the Keurig CONS 1) No manual shut off for carafe warmer plate...the only way to turn the warmer off is to keep the setting on the single cup brewer although I understand it automatically will shut off in 2 hours. 2) the water takes a long time to heat when compared with the Keurig which only takes seconds 3) separate water reservoirs for carafe and single cup brew 4) no setting for water temperature...I set on 'bold' strength setting and the water was tepid...I switched to regular and it was hot...but after switching back and forth between these two settings (don't recall how many times) the temperature of the water is now satisfactorily hot. Not sure why that would effect anything but it did. 5) the warmer plate for the carafe doesn't keep the coffee very hot 6) you will have to pull it out from under a cabinet to add water as it is poured into the top of the reservoir the same way as an old coffee maker instead of having a detachable water reservoir the way Keurig does 7) although you can set a brew time for the carafe side you can not do it for the single serve side 8) you have to add water every time you want to brew a single cup With this all said...I gave it a 3-star review because it failed to meet the expectations for true convenience and dependability. One should not expect to have problems with the temperature of the brew when purchasing a brand new machine. :-(,PROS AND CONS ARE SIGNIFICANT,Amazon,1

I suppose I could love the cheaper version without the thermal carafe also, the thermal carafe adds a fair amount to the retail price.  I've NEVER been a fan of Hamilton Beach Coffee makers, so this is a big deal for me.  I've owned several by cuisinart. The Hamilton Beach 49966 is perhaps the most flexible coffee maker I've ever used.  The thermal carafe allows coffee to sit for much longer period of time and remain fresh.  The ability to make a single pod with the K cup is also great.  But perhaps the greatest feature is the K Cup basket which you can put your own grounds into, allowing you to make a single cup at a time with whatever coffee grounds you have around.  This last detail is the icing on the cake, and even compels me to stop buying Nespresso pods for my Nespresso Pixie!  You can buy this kind of basket separately, but, its nice that it was included. The 49966 is 'big' on your counter, its like having two coffee makers in one.  There are even two water reservoirs.  They share electronics and a power supply, but everything else is pretty separate.  My wife wasn't really happy with how big the 'footprint' was on the counter.  But the flexibility of the coffee maker makes it well worth it. The coffee tasted very good, the first time.  If you know much about coffee, you know the water quality is very important to getting a tasty cup.  If you aren't happy with the flavor of your coffee, try some better water before you make any other changes and see how that helps. The programming was easy and didn't require the included instructions. My only negative: The carafe does not have any markings inside it to allow you to help fill the water reservoir (or at least, i didn't notice any).  Glass carafes you can more easily see how much water you are adding.  This is to be expected, I suppose, because I wouldn't want any ink in there and if the water levels were stamped in the metal then it might be a little harder to clean than a flat surface.  So I can't remove a star for that, it just is what it is.",The most flexible coffee maker I've ever owned!,Amazon,0

The K-cup portion makes an individual cup of coffee but does take just as long as the drip coffee side and is slower than a regular keurig, still makes a good tasting cup of coffee. The K- cup side also comes with a filter for making regular coffee grinds. It also has a programmable timer which starts making coffee at the specified time. It also has an adjustable brew strength feature for both sides,  between regular and bold. It makes a slightly stronger cup of coffee, but that is debatable with your personal preferences.

He likes to brew 2-3 cups, enjoying a couple at home and then filling a cup to take on the way to work. I only drink one cup, but I like mine easy to make (I am not a fan of making the drip coffee each morning). So this machine fills those 2 needs perfectly with a couple annoyances on the side. First off, no problems with brewing from either side. Both the drip coffee and K-Cups worked fine. Both came out hot, which has been a trial and error for us with coffee makers. We found it easy to use. The pain comes with filling the reservoirs. For us, the larger drip water reservoir is on the opposite side of our sink. This meant pulling it out from under the cabinet and filling with a cup or pitcher. A lot of the water dripped or spilled and made a mess. This is why I don't like to brew drip coffee. The complaint on the K-Cup side is that it only holds one cup of water at a time. So each morning I have to refill. That's a pain in my butt. Does this outweigh the fact that we'd have to have 2 different coffee makers for our needs? No. So we will keep this and not complain.","Pain to refill water, but vrews good, hot coffee",Amazon,0

I have he original version and  have loved and used it for YEARS.... The convenience of having a single serve and a carafe  is the IDEAL  machine.for this house   I was looking at the newest version and am so happy I did. I got the  version that has the Thermal Carafe.. This is my first having something other than a glass carafe. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Several things to note:   Set up is SIMPLE remove from the box , run some plain water through both the single side and then through the  full pot 1.) Then you go to the  Control panel.. select either SINGLE or CARAFE  2.)Then you  then nx option is to either take the coffee as is or select BOLD  ( this works for both the Single serve and the Carafe) Fill the appropriate side w water..  Single serve either  use the recommended  8 oz for K Cups or  fill to 14 oz for the included My K Cup w your own coffee   3.)  Place a Kcup if you choose that or My K Cup if you choose that into the carrier close the lid and press down  HIT  START  place the appropriate cup or tall travel mug  and away it GOES>>>>>>>>>>> .......... the first  cup take a bit of time approx 2 minutes  to heat the water... the 2nd single serve goes much faster. My coffee was HOT and PLEASANT....... I have no complaints at all Now if you are brewing the carafe 1.) fill w the carafe and add to that side of the machine you have measurements on the side to see how many cups you want to make........ the disadvantage to the Thermal carafe is you cannot tell how much water you have in it .. till you pour into the machine.. 2,).......... add coffee to the brew area..  PLEASE NOTE . NO PAPER FILTERS WERE SUPPLIED  SO BE PREPARED. I HAVE A PERMANENT FILTER FROM MY PREVIOUS FLEX BREW THAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. .3.)... then you choose either to brew as is or hit BOLD  then hit Carafe and START  ..........................Very HOT coffee is brewed .. right into the thermal Carafe... .Now here is the real Advantage to the Thermal Carafe.......... after the coffee is brewed you can take the carafe RIGHT TO THE TABLE  for all of you family or guests to serve themselves.. The coffee will stay hot for approx 4 hours.. ................. and you NEVER GET THAT BURNED COFFEE TASTE.............. SO..VERDICT ;  I LIKE IT .. I like it AT LOT ............ Only thing you need to know is the carafe is heavier than a glass on so be prepared . Clean up was simple  and easier to use the next time you  want some yummy coffee but now w the kcup option.. you can brew TEA or of the other  things the K Cups sell  like Apple Cider ..... My experience so far has been stellar.. The Single side works as  advertised..  It is a little slow on the first cup esp if you select  BOLD version of coffee In this house the MY K cup will probably be used more than Kcup just due to the price of the Kcups.. but I like having some Decaf  for family that needs or wants it. .............. I can highly recommend this Flex Brew...

The counter-space required for this is not much bigger, but it provides much more capability since it brews (up to) a 14-oz single serve cup on the Keurig side (whereas my traditional Keurig only made 10 oz).  Additionally, it brews a full carafe on the other side. I used to own a  Hamilton Beach 49983 2-Way FlexBrew Coffeemaker , but I rarely used it because it didn't come with a K-Cup adapter (although you could buy one for $50 if you wanted to), and I rarely had the need for a full carafe of coffee.  Furthermore, the glass carafe always made me nervous about dropping or mishandling it. The brew options between the two flexbrews are about the same, the only real difference between the two models is that this one comes with the K-Cup adapter and a stainless steel carafe.  All other features operate identically: 1. The water reservoirs do not store water.  When you brew a cup or carafe, the machine uses all the water available in the reservoir, which means you have to pre-fill with exactly the amount of coffee you want to make before you brew.  It's not as convenient as what we are used to with the Keurig machines that hold days worth of water in their reservoir.  However, it gets the job done. 2. You can set your coffee to brew at a pre-programmed time. 3. You can use K-cups with the included adapter OR you can fill a filter with coffee grounds on the single-serve side.  The special re-usable filter is s stored inside the single-serve pedestal (the thing that the cup in the picture is placed on top of). 4. There are two separate reservoirs that you fill depending on if you want a carafe or a single-serve cup.  You simply push a button that states which side you want to brew on, then press brew, and you're done. There are no super-fancy features other than the 'brew type' button (regular/bold) and the 'brew side' button (carafe or single serve).  Other than that, your basic coffee maker.",Great dual-use coffee maker,Amazon,1

So glad we bought it. Every part of it works flawlessly. Take the bad reviews with a grain of salt, as you should all Amazon reviews. I actually saw someone rate it only 3 stars because it didn't fit under their counter. Come on. Yes, it's big. You should be able to tell that just by looking at it. I did see a lot of reviews where it broke. I get that. Maybe find one in a store so it's easier to return. Sorry, Amazon. :D Another reviewer docked it a star because you have to fill the one cup side every time you use it. Again, you should know that before you buy it and not take a star off for it. We had a single serve Keurig before this and it only made one size cup. Talk about lame. I love that I can make any size cup I want now. Small cup? No problem. Travel mug? Done. It's fantastic and a major reason I bought this and gave away that single cup Keurig. If you want a giant reservoir then this thing WOULD be too big. Small price to pay to be able to brew a pot when you know it's a coffee kind of day. Going on 4 months with ours and it still works great. I love being able to use ground coffee in the 'fill it yourself cup'. Occasionally that will make a bad cup of coffee if you overfill the container. The ground get too packed and the water has a hard time getting through so it makes a weaker cup. NOT A DESIGN FLAW. Don't over fill it. Highly recommend this.",Pot? Check. KCup? Check.

I've only had it two weeks, but it is awesome.  My husband and I drink a lot of coffee, but he gets up much earlier than me for work so with our traditional maker I was getting burnt coffee in the morning, and having two machines just seemed silly. This maker comes with it's own single filter which is surprisingly large so you can choose your coffee strength instead of using a k-cup which will water down if you want a larger cup of coffee. My husband loves this filter and uses it daily so I can wake up to fresher coffee on the carafe side. The coffee brews quickly on both sides and you can even choose a brew strength. It's also nice because if one of us wants an afternoon/evening cup of coffee but the other doesn't, we're not wasting any coffee, and we all know how expensive coffee can get.  I highly recommend this coffee maker for pretty much anyone, if you are a heavy coffee drinker then you have your choice and if you don't drink a lot of coffee but have company over frequently it's nice to have the single side for your daily use and the carafe for when you have guests.",The two in one is the way to go,Amazon,1

I stay at home with my kids and so I use the single cup all week, and on the weekends when my hubby is home we usually use the big pot. Something to keep in mind, is the single cup does not work like a Keurig!!! A Keurig has a holding tank and a pump to pour the same specific amount of water at a specific speed. This does not. This single cup brewer percolates the same as the big coffee pot. The single cup brews up to 14 oz of coffee, and theres a fill line specifically for if you are using a k-cup. Since this doesn’t brew with a pump like the Keurig, I notice that it takes a little more coffee grounds in the brew basket to have your coffee taste the same if not better than a kcup. Once you put your grounds in the basket, it helps to lightly press the grounds in the filter so they don’t move when the water percolates over them. Single cup doesn’t work with the program button, but honestly, all you have to do is put your grounds in the basket the night before and fill to the desired water line, leave your mug under the pour spout and just hit the on button in the morning. I don’t think it takes a long time to brew a cup like others have said, because if you’ve set it up the night before, push start and get your breakfast, its done before that. This is a great machine if you’re trying to save space from multiple pots. The cup tray for the single brew is a compartment to hold the brew basket or kcup basket.

The single serving brewer worked ok for the first month or so, but started getting slower and slower at brewing single servings.  It now takes anywhere from 3-4 minutes to brew a single cup.  It also encounters 'NEEDLE' errors FREQUENTLY.  I have to take it apart and clean out the needle as instructed every time I brew a cup of coffee now.  It started showing the error 2-3 times a week, but now it runs across that error EVERY time we brew single servings now.  We use brand name K-cups (Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, etc), so it's not like we are using unreliable K-cups in the machine.  The full pot brewer makes coffee ALOT stronger than other coffee pots, so if you grind your own coffee or use pre-ground coffee, you might want to use less coffee and/or more water for every pot. We plan on donating this FlexBrew to my wife's office breakroom and invest in an actual Keurig coffee system.

It's fine for day to day use, there aren't any huge issues with it. However, I'm also not very impressed with the quality for the price I paid.

I was not impressed with this coffee maker. The single brew is more of a hassle than it was worth. Having to pour only the amount of water needed, can be a pain in the neck. The needle created to puncture the K-cup, is not sharp at all, and you need to really push down hard to puncture the cup. Almost feels like something is going to snap. The carafe brew was somewhat better. I did run through clear water on both sides to clear out anything that may have been in the machine, but the carafe side seemed to have a taste almost plastic-like.

Initially it looks like a cool machine with the multifeature brewing, and for the first couple months it seemed to work ok but after that it’s a rapid downhill slide. It’s very flimsy and the pieces slop together and don’t seal well. A couple months of use distorted the cheap plastic to the point the tube is no longer held in the seal so half the water steams off and never brews. So for a 12 cup pot you get 6-8 cups of coffee after 30 mins of bubbling and gurgling. Same for the single cup side.

One of the biggest reasons is because when using the kpods we ended up with a ton of coffee grounds in our cup and as time went by it was as if all of the ground went into the cup rendering it undrinkable and wasting our k-cups. We boxed it up and brought the keurig back out. We were wondering if the pods were bad but soon  realized that it was this HB coffee maker that was the problem because we have had no problem since switching back to the keurig. 5/21/18 Update: our Keurig recently died (4 years old) so we had to bring this back out. Right away it was back to blowing up our pods spewing coffee grounds and coffee all over the place. We cleaned out the needles, all holes were scrubbed out and blown out to ensure they were clear etc. So far (1 cup brewed) and it's working fine. I still don't like the fact that I have to do this since I have never had to do this with our Keurig. So it seems that if you don't want a mess you need to clean those needles out and ensure all holes are clear before each use.

I was disappointed with the result. The coffee was only so-so and just did not have the flavor of that produced by the Krups. After about a week of disappointing coffee, I increased the amount of coffee just a little bit, probably by about 5%. The improvement was significant. Now I'm satisfied with the coffee this machine produces. Today I tried the single serving feature for the first time. I cut my measurements for two servings exactly in half and used the filter that enables you to brew your own ground coffee. I was disappointed. However, I noticed that the output was a little more than the size of the cup I normally drink from, whereas I get exactly two cups full using the carafe. I don't plan to use this feature very often, but the next time I try it, I will back off on the water a little bit. Seemingly small amounts of water can make a noticeable difference when you're brewing only a small amount of coffee. I watched the stream of coffee dripping into my cup during the brewing process, and I didn't like what I observed. The stream would come out in waves. At the beginning of a wave, the stream was dark, but the stream was very watery looking during the second half of the wave. I suppose it averages out in the end, but I didn't like it. The only other K cup machine I ever used was a Keurig this past winter in the condo I was renting. It was quite good. The condo was stocked with the K cup pods and so I just used them even though I object to the prefabricated pods for environmental reasons, even if they are convenient. I don't know if I could get this Hamilton Beach to produce single serving coffee like that, but I know I would have to use less water to achieve it. I agree with a point made by a another reviewer. The single serving filter just barely fits into the storage compartment. I have to fiddle with it in order to get the filter in the compartment perfectly so that the lid goes on properly. I'm not sure exactly what I do to get it to fit, but for some reason, it finally goes on after about 10 seconds of fiddling. Not a big deal, but it is a little bit annoying. Making the compartment 1 mm taller would have avoided that problem. This product comes with only a 2-foot power cord. It should have at least a 3-foot cord. I really get irritated when manufactures skimp on something so cheap. I guess the 5 cents per unit they save is going into someone's pocket. Ironically, they have a nice little compartment to store excess cord, but with a 2-foot cord, there isn't likely to be any excess cord unless the outlet is right behind the unit just to the left. All in all, it's an okay coffee maker. I've got the carafe option working to my satisfaction. I might get the single serving feature to produce better coffee after some more experimentation, but I'm not as concerned about that.","After some tweaking, I got the coffee tasting pretty good",Amazon,6

It's been over two weeks now, I'm still very impressed!!  First thing, was to put all removable parts in the dishwasher, then ran a light vinegar an water thru each side, then 3 times each with just plan water to clean it out good. Had to leave just as the last pot finished, unplugged it an left.  4 1/2 hours later returning home, decided to see how hot the stainless steel insulated craft had keep the water?  Let me tell you!!!  It was still very 'HOT'!!  OUCH!! It burned my fingers!! It was still almost boiling hot water!! Granted it just had 3 other pots ran thru it, so the craft was already warmed up... As for the single serve K-cup side, I'm also still as impressed, (don't tell H B this, but you can put '18 oz of water' in this side without overflowing)  I use a regular 16 oz (2 cups) measuring cup to pour water into the reservoir, (because most coffee cups don't pour without dripping an running water down the side). set on Bold, so far coffee has come out just fine. 'Warning! I did however snap the little handle off of the hinged brew basket coffee ground lid holder first time I used it', my fault, was holding it wrong, still usable, so far have not been able to find the replacement part listed for this yet...  Also remember to put a coffee cup on the drip tray!!  or you will have a big mess to clean up!!  LoL... If asked for a suggestion to make this a better coffee maker, it would be to ad a bigger water reservoir for the single serve side like the Keurig has.  You have to ad the water for each cup of coffee you make.  Would also make the stainless steel insulated craft a 12 cup size instead of the 10 cup size it is now...",Very Impressed!!,Amazon,0

After some research, I found that this is an issue known to Hamilton Beach for several years. When I contacted them, I mentioned this and was told that model 49976 was just released in 2017 as an 'improved' model. When I asked what had been done to correct correct the leakage issue, I was told that there are now 2 reservoirs instead of one. Obviously the issue has not been corrected as I tried to use the single brew feature today and it also leaked. I am being sent a new, not refurbished, coffeemaker within 7-10 business days after having to pay for shipping. When I asked the CSR to escalate my concern about reliability to a higher level, she responded 'Spell your last name' and proceeded as if she did not hear me.

As others have stated, not all K-cups work with this machine.  Generally I have found that Green Mountain k-cups uniformly work well, other brands - not so much.  What I have discovered is that the venture that pierces the bottom of the cup tends to block up with finer ground coffees.  Typically your darker, bolder brews.  One brand, Doughnut House, will foul the venturi and bust the top of the k-cup quickly.  On the positive side the included brew basket works pretty well, though the finer ground coffees will pass through the filter.  Brewing a pot works well, which is why we bought this machine, since we found that we needed a full pot of coffee occasionally when we had guests in.  Having considered all, I would not get this machine again.  Cleaning the venture is a nuisance.  I think I would get a Kurig machine instead, and keep an old fashion drip brewer for doing a pot of coffee. Well I need to update my review down to one star!  The coffee maker failed!  A couple of days ago it started brewing only a couple oz. of water for each cup but would brew a full cup if you cycled it two or three times.  This morning we noticed a leak underneath the machine.  This thing went into the garbage this morning.  Stick with Keurig.

There is a LOT of mud at the bottom of my cup when i use it. This is with medium coffee grinds, not fine. The included filter for the carafe is OK, however i still use a paper filter instead. Other: -There are several rubber or plastic seals I've noticed that i question their lifespans.

I had been going back and forth for months on replacing my coffee maker. Do I get a drip or single cup maker? Which brand? What if I get one and want the other? These are thoughts that would keep me up at night and make my dependency on coffee more desperate. Then I came across this life saver. For less than a traditional keurig machine, this was offering me two ways to make my coffee. Angels starting singing, champagne fell from the sky and I ordered without delay. When it arrived I had that moment of fear, did I get bamboozled? Would the coffee not be as amazing? Would the single cup not work with k-cups? Thankfully all my fears were for not. Both the single cup and the drip make perfect coffee every time. The only advice I give is that if you have used a keurig you will know that that they have 'cup' sizes to chose from (6,8,10) usually I use select 10 and it makes great coffee so I thought that by filling the water to 10 it would be the same...not so...I had to fill to 12...just a word to the wise.

Coffee turns out strong (as I like it) but not bitter. - But if you want to stir the grounds, it is possible to partially lift the lid which is not an option for all makers - Water temp is hot enough - Top opening of reservoir is wide enough to poor water in quickly. - Buttons & display are large. Settings are very intuitive. - Smart but not TOO smart. My previous machine was a $400 Oxo Barista. I love Oxo products and it made great coffee but its 'brain' and hyper-sensitive weight sensors and scale detectors caused it to constantly shut down. After one year I had to trash it. - Great value, especially with the K-cup option. Standard K-cups do fit and brew properly. Minor dislikes: - Warming tray is not temp-adjustable, but I immediately move to a thermos anyway. - The water disperser head is better than mos but I wish it was a little wider. Again, with the Bold setting all grounds do soak so this is not the issue it is with other drip machines. - Individual cup size for 12-cup carafe is 4.0 oz and not 4.5. That seems std now but I feel l'm getting 11 cups and not 12. - Not exactly a chic design. I can look past that for the function and value.",Meets my checklist after much comparison shopping.,Amazon,0

After two months with this new pot, the K-Cup side of the pot also failed. Nothing we could do would clear the error message on the display, but the regular pot side of the maker continued to work fine. Since I also purchased the extended warranty, I tried to file a claim, but their website said 'Good news! (for them) Your pot is still under manufacturer's warranty'. I called the Hamilton Beach 800 number and heard the lengthy wait time and decided to go a different route. Reading some of the Amazon reviews of this pot, I saw that Hamilton Beach was reaching out to customers with problems and gave a different phone number and email address. I sent them an email detailing what happened to K-Cup side of the pot, what corrective measures we attempted, and asked for help. The following business day, they asked for the series number and our shipping address. A few days later, UPS delivered our new pot and we're good to go again. Clearly, they had a defect in one of the production series and they were quick to remedy the problem with no hassles.

Unfortunately, this machine does not deliver that for me, but it's still a great product. One side is a standard coffee maker that brews a pot of coffee. The feature I like best about this is the gold mesh filter that's included with the product. This type of filter allows the flavorful oils of the coffee to pour into the pot. When you use a paper filter, most of that gets absorbed. The downside is the messy clean-up. However, I typically drink just one cup of coffee in the morning, so brewing a pot would be a waste. Which leads me to the other side of the coffee maker, where you can brew a Keurig-style, single cup of coffee. The design of this part of the coffee maker is ingenious. There are two different options for brewing. One allows you to insert a standard Keurig cup. The other option is a do-it-yourself single cup, which allows you to brew a single cup of coffee with regular ground coffee. It also includes a gold mesh filter for added flavor. You can store the attachment you're not using in the base of that side of the coffee maker. You can also adjust the height to accommodate taller 'to go' style cups. This would be perfect for me if I could pack more coffee into the basket for an extra-strong cup of coffee. It only holds about 3 tablespoons, and I use 6 in my current method of a pour over brew. Even when I use the 'bold' setting, my coffee is just too weak. For most people, this won't be a problem. If you don't need a really strong, single cup of coffee then you will probably love this. The price is very reasonable for all the options and accessories included.",Great value for a multi-tasking coffee maker but the single serve is not strong enough for me,Amazon,0

It is easy to clean, easy to make coffee in the carafe and the single serve side.

If you leave it at the back of the counter you will probably spill some of the water into the coffee grounds. The coffee is delicious and hot, whether in the carafe or made on the single serve side. When people complain about the temperature of the coffee, they may be forgetting that the coffe cups are cold to begin with, so the coffee cools quickly. I try to heat my coffee cups when the coffee is brewing, so that I pour into a warm or hot coffee cup, which keeps my hot coffee hot much longer. Clean up is very easy. Lovin it.",Great coffee maker,Amazon,1

It replaced a Keurig because I wanted the option to brew coffee or use a k-cup if I needed coffee quickly. I'll start with the carafe brew option.  After 8 months of daily use the top lid has cracked and it leaks every time we brew coffee.  I'm not sure if one had anything to do with the other, I cannot tell.  There is about a quarter cup of water on the counter each time we brew.  This pot does brew slowly, but thankfully the programmed brew does work well. The k-cup option is not very good either.  I rarely use it because it takes so long to brew.  The coffee often has a burnt taste after brewing.  I've never tried to program the single cup option, I don't believe that is an option for K-cups.  The machine also recently, on maybe the 6th use, wanted to be cleaned.  I'm not sure why it wanted to be cleaned after such infrequent use, but it did.  Unfortunately, I was not alerted that it wanted to be cleaned until after I was trying to rush out of the house... no coffee that morning.  It would have been nice if alerted after the last brew instead of not brewing at all.  I don't use this option any longer so I essentially have an $80 coffee pot that I could have gotten much cheaper.

I found hers to be a bit fussy to set up and use and it was about $200.  I decide to look at other options and found this Hamilton Beach for $79.  The only significant difference is that the Cuisinart has a built in water filter. I think the coffee comes out of this maker just as good as it does in more the more expensive maker.  If filtered water for your coffee is really important, buy a filter pitcher. My only criticism is that the pot does not drain entirely and is a bit tricky to wash.

I was the only person to use the product.  I cleaned it regularly.  It worked fine for 4 months and then it didn't.  I only use filtered water; and I've examined the various parts and I can't figure out why the heated water no longer flows up and into the coffee pods. So now I grind my own coffee and I use the carafe side of the Flex 2-Way Brewer.  It works fine, but now I have a collection of unused coffee pods.  And since I live alone, I prefer the single-serve pods over the carafe.  At this point I'm thinking maybe this was just a one-off problem, and I'm thinking of ordering another Flex Brew 2-Way Brewer, and throwing my 4 month old Flex Brew 2-Way Brewer into the trash when the new one arrives.  I can keep the carafe from my present one just in case. I have checked pretty much all the single-brew coffee makers and they all seem to have problems.

I cleaned everything HB says to but nothing worked. The carafe side still works. I called HB two weeks ago and they told me they would send me a new maker and to cut the power cord to the old one and dispose of. I have not, of course, received a new maker yet and no word from them as to why. In order to rectify this situation I am probably going to have to contact the insurance company to see what they can do. I used to have a Keurig maker and it worked flawlessly, not so this one. HB is a large company and they should have better customer service. Very disappointed. Update...I called HB this morning and found out that they never processed the replacement maker! So now, they are ostensibly sending me the maker. Time will tell. I'm also concerned about the single side not working on many of these makers. If it fails again, and I'm expecting it to, I will get another separate, single serve maker that I can rely on.

I know that's a first-world problem, but it's  disappointment. Along the same lines, it's actually pretty slow, taking almost 5 minutes from the time you push the button to actually produce a cup of coffee. Update: a few months later, it's much, much, worse. It now dispenses about 3 ounces and stops. You push the button again. Three more ounces. Repeat until you get 12 ounces or so.

It is slow, as many have pointed out, but the coffee is good from both carafe & single-serve sides. But it died after only 5 months. :( This morning, it began leaking water PROFUSELY from the bottom. We haven't made a single-serve cup in a week, and we don't overfill the carafe side. Trying to make a full pot of coffee puts 9 cups of coffee into the carafe and the equivalent of 3 cups of warm water on the counter. I hope very much that this is a one-off and that HB replaces this unit with a sound one. We do like the coffeemaker. One more thing: not cool using TRI-WING SCREWS, Hamilton-Beach. I was going to at least open up the bottom to see if some tubing had become loose, but HB is apparently worried their product will be tampered with. So we wait. UPDATE: I logged a warranty claim with HB customer service yesterday and received a response today promising to replace the unit. I'm disappointed this one failed, of course, but I have to give them props for excellent service.

I have used the k-cups, and coffee grounds, both work great. The filters used are basket style, which I had from the last coffee maker I had.

Before THIS happened, the brewer was fine and was worthy of a 4-5 star review. Within the last couple of days the machine has been leaking like a sieve from the bottom and going all over the counter... and only brewing half the pot. I tried cleaning with vinegar, thinking maybe a clog from hard water, it still leaked. So I took the bottom apart and noticed the main water tube that carries the water from the reservoir up into the part where it drips, was loose... so loose that when I pulled, it came...so i pulled a little more, it came a little more and eventually I had the open end of the tube in my hands. There's a little 'spring' kinda ring around the end of the tube to keep it fastened where it's supposed to go... that was also loose (which is why the tube came off so easy in the first place). So I identified the problem... now trying to get that end of the tube BACK ON to where it's supposed to be is near impossible. You can't even SEE the opening with the bare eye, and with flashlights. You'd have to completely disassemble the entire machine to reattach that tube. There's no way I'm going through all of that. I'll also note that the screws to remove the bottom base aren't your typical screw, they're kinda like triangle screws but even different (picture the shape of a fidget spinner or something). Also, when trying to remove the base, I noticed that one of the screws was ALREADY STRIPPED OUT! Leading me to wonder if this was a refurbished machine? At any rate, this thing was only 5 months old (to us, who knows if it was refurbished) and upon further research I find that this happens quite often to other owners (some were able to fix, others not). Seems kinda BS that this issue would not only happen so frequently, but within only a few months.

You can put enough water in there for a 16oz cup but the filter is so small it'll be weak, at least to me. Forced to use the carafe for a very standard thermos size which is pretty silly.

Could use a few improvements: reduced footprint (takes up too much counter space, especially side-to-side), keep-warm time options (2-4 hrs), better water reservoir level placement/visibility and a no-carafe model (that brews 'potful' like Hamilton Beach Brew Station). Coffee tastes good, especially when BOLD brew option is used (tho takes even longer).  Single-serve works well with 8 oz coffee & cocoa and both sides produce VERY hot beverages.  Removable single-serve pedestal great for ground coffee brew pod and accommodating travel mug. Update - Brewed coffee was good and single-serve was nice for the 'odd man out' beverage references.  However, for the price, I expected it to last more than 8 months.  Imagine my surprise (at 5 a.m.) in discovering that only 6 cups of the water made it into the carafe, with the other half of the full pot reservoir flooded across the countertop and puddled on the floor.  Pumping mechanism bit the dust. Hamilton Beach took almost a week to respond to my 'it broke under warranty' filing.  Unfortunately, their tiny black-on-black serial number was illegible and their 1 year warranty puts me on the hook for shipping costs going and returning.  For that much cash, it was faster and easier to buy a new (DIFFERENT) coffee maker that not only makes good coffee and will actually fit where it has to go - for A LOT LESS money than this $90 rip-off.","Great for ""mixed preference"" households - until it breaks",Amazon,1

Just fill the resevoire with the amount you need each time you use the coffee maker and that is the amount that will come out.

The B&D forced us to pour a cup of coffee over the sink every time in order to keep spilled coffee off of the counter... It trained us to compensate for it's dribble prone design. One day the B&D quit and I was like 'yay' and we went shopping. There were a lot of options out there and a k-cup option seemed neat for entertaining. I looked at reviews and decided, for the money, Keurig was not what we needed. At $80, the most we would choose to spend, the Hamilton Beach looked real good and we went with it. We use the k-cup option entirely too much and though slower than a Keurig, it brews hot and fast enough for a fresh cup of coffee. We'll usually have our morning kcups and then brew a pot to carry us through the rest of the morning - if we don't lazily default to just relying on the k-cup through the day. I'm tight with a dollar and 'worried' that this brewer would prove an opportunity for me to berate myself for being unwisely cheap but this thing has rewarded my decision every morning with a clean pour of a solid brew. That's my story and I'm sticking to it! Hope your experience is as good!",Gamble paid off,Amazon,0

Carafe works fine, and tastes fine, but you can get that for 1/3rd the price of this coffee maker. What draws you to this? It does carafe and single cup. Except it doesn’t actually do single cup. You’ll get maybe ten cups of coffee out of the single brew side before it gives out. First its “NEEDLE” meaning the needle is clogged with coffee grounds. You cannot avoid this, it is a design problem, thus the solution is to clean the needle. Great. Clean the needle, go to brew a cup of coffee. Does it brew? Of course not! The machine insists that the needle is not clean, no matter how clean it is. I blew water and air through it, scraped it out as the manual suggested, this needle was clean. I go to brew that cup of coffee. Does it brew? Nope. Now it doesn’t even bother giving a needle fault, it just turns itself off and back on again whenever I try brewing single cup. Or it just cancels the brew altogether. No way to clean it as the machine refuses to suck water out of the reservoir. It just boils it and gives up. Save yourself the trouble (and money), get a mr. coffee or something that will actually brew you a cup. Edit: Just pulled out a black & decker single cup brewer.

We missed our Keurig(s) because of the option of different coffees, but swore I’d never get another Keurig due to the expense and the fact they died quickly - even if you follow the directions to the letter! So it is refreshing to have one machine take the place of two. This is about the same size as the full size Keurig we had. Easier to move for cleaning the counter. Makes a good cup of coffee, you have to play with the amount of water to coffee ratio to find what works for you/family. For the full size pot I found I needed approx 1/2 tbsp more coffee than my prior coffee pot. The machine came with one of those gold filters as an add on. I didn’t like it as I was getting a lot of grounds in my coffee. Tried a paper filter and the coffee was even better, but now I use both a paper and the gold filters together.  The K-cup side works great but be aware it perks SLOW and that is because it has to heat the water up first. Water is not stored in a reservoir and is added as needed per cup.

I thought it would be great to have the 'k cup' size feature when desiring a single cup of coffee.  However, the 'single serve' feature (using your own ground coffee, not a k cup) does not work well.  Either it overflowed, or all of the grounds did not get wet, so the coffee would be weak.  As others have described, the single serve does take a quite a few minutes to heat the water and then dispense.  I personally can live with that, but I know some would need it much faster.  My biggest problem is with the drip side.  The water level is waaaaayyyyy off.  If I want 6 cups (my usual morning brew) I have to fill it to at least a bit over the 7 cup mark.  I have gotten used to this, even though every brew is different (but never as much water as you put in).  A few times we have wanted 9 - 10 cups, but have gotten weak or strong coffee since we didn't know how much water to start with.  This was a Christmas gift.

The positives to me are that I like having the choice of a single cup or a pot of coffee.  I like that I can put pretty much any sized container on the single brew side as previous brewers were limited.  I like that I can make a larger sized cup of coffee when using the single brewer and I can choose regular or bold and I only need one K-Cup whereas with my previous brewer I had to use two K-Cups for a larger container and for a stronger brew.  I also like the brew basket to be able to use ground coffee.  My previous brewer had a much smaller basket and there were always grounds in the bottom of the cup.  The brew basket that comes with this brewer doesn't leave any grounds.  The drawbacks to me are that there isn't a power button so you have to plug it in and unplug it unless you set the time and then you can just leave it plugged in.  I would rather be able to leave it plugged in but have a turn on and off button.  I noticed that for single brew it does take a bit longer than my previous brewer as it appears to actually 'brew' or percolate and it can be a little loud.  While I do like the fact that for the single brewer the amount of water that you put in is the amount of water that comes out I often I forget to add the water as with my previous brewer it had a larger reservoir and I filled it every other day.  If I forget the water it either indicates that H2O needs to be added or it tries to cycle to the cleaning mode.  Finally once or twice when I plugged it in I forgot to change the mode to single as the default is carafe and when I hit 'brew now' it was trying to brew for the carafe and the plate where the pot sits got very warm and if I didn't check quickly enough I think the carafe could have gotten hot enough to crack from the heat.  All in all I am happy with my purchase as I have been enjoying my fresher cup of coffee in the mornings.  I am hoping to use the carafe shortly and await to see how well it works.,Great brewer for the price,Amazon,0

Compared to the 49983A, this model is MUCH more difficult to fill.  The reservoir is located at the far back of the unit (right up against the door which folds back) which makes it very difficult to tilt the pot enough to get all of the water out.

It has the single brew feature, which I love, since I have tons of leftover k-cups from my Keurig coffee makers (all useless and in the trash, now) and I love the fact that it doesn't reject any brand of k-cup, making it less of a hassle -and less expensive- to buy whatever brand you like. It also has the carafe brew feature, for when we have people over (My husband has his own -fancy- coffee maker), so I can brew up to 12 cups of coffee (10 for us, actually, since we use the larger coffee mugs). It's not a monster of a machine, so it doesn't take up too much kitchen counter space. You also have the choice of using your own ground coffee for the single brew, instead of a k-cup. It comes with everything you need (except the filter for brewing a carafe).

When I got my Keurig I got rid of my coffee pot and even though the pods are convenient there is a time for the pot of coffee just works better.  I saw this and upon reading the reviews wanted to give it a shot.  It is also no bigger than my old Keurig and fits perfectly on my counter.  This thing is nothing beyond amazing and would rate it 10 stars if I could. First it is very easy to operate with limited number of buttons, easy to program to have timer brew coffee in the morning, brew carafe manually or to do a pod.  The coffee comes out perfect every time.  On carafe I like how the filter basket comes out so easy to remove old filter and coffee grounds.  On pod side I like the fact that I can pour the exact amount of water that I need for the pod.  My old Keurig had four sizes which Inthought were unnecessary for pods.  The water also used to leak in the base frequently if the base was not perfectly set.  Not on this maker, you pour water in and it quickly heats up directly into your cup.  It also comes with the cup so you can use your own grounds on pod side. This maker truly is the best of both worlds and I am loving it every day!!!  You won’t be disappointed! **UPDATE** This coffee maker is beyond great, I find myself using the carafe about 85% of the time, coffee comes out amazing.  When I use filtered water from my fridge and brew cold  it is better than Dunkin Donuts.

It's performed admirably for us with no issues; the only downside is that it uses only CBTL's proprietary cups. (I have a French press but sometimes time is of the essence and I don't want to make an entire production out of the coffee-making process.) I had been looking for a machine that uses K-Cups for maximum variety and had settled on one, when this Flexbrew machine came to my attention. I LOVE the flexibility. I can use any of a wide variety of K-cups for single-serve use, which is most of the time. Occasionally, however, I want to brew larger amounts and/or use my own ground beans (Black Rifle, Bulletproof, Pure Coffee Club) and this machine allows me to do both. And by both I mean I can grind my beans and make a whole (small) carafe of coffee, or use the insert to make a single cup. Wifey is a tea drinker so she's covered as well. Plus I can set the timer and have coffee waiting for me when I wake up? What a world we're living in! That said, it has some drawbacks. For one, adding water every time I want to brew a single cup is a bit of a hassle (even if it is a First World problem). And even if you've just brewed a cup, it still takes three and a half minutes to brew a single--which can feel like forever when you need your java. So although it looks great and offers flexibility, I'm sticking with my current machine. TWO MONTHS LATER...

The unit itself is larger than I thought; when filling the carafe side with water, the lid won't lift unless the unit is pulled out from under the cupboard. That's an annoyance because it is heavy. But my biggest concern is the loud vibration noise the pump makes on the single brew side, especially for last 10-15 seconds before it turns off when it kicks into high gear and sounds like it is failing. Other buyers have noted the same thing and we can't determine if this is a defect that will shorten the life of the machine or if the manufacturer simply didn't care enough to fix the design.

I love the familiar parts to the old one so I can still use my same paper filters, same routine of separate water reservoirs,etc. I love that I can now use K-cups when I'm in the mood for something different. K-cup side worked perfectly, read manual for the little tips to prevent issues arising one of them is you have to be make sure you hear the needle pierce the foil and also make sure you press down on the lid of the single side until it click into place, rinse out the k-cup attachments and the black removable piece underneath after each use to prevent clogging on next use. I set the machine to auto-brew for this morning and it worked as it should, coffee taste great and is hot! Before first use I ran each side with a full pot/cup of filtered water as instructed.

I'm a Keurig user from way back and actually prefer it. However, there are people in my household who find the Keurig 'adjustment curve' to be too much and like the 'old' way. Enter the Hamilton Beach Flexbrew. First of all, this machine is bigger than the picture lets on; at least it feels that way. The box it came in was huge. The reservoir is in the back, which can be annoying if you have limited counter space or the space between the bottom of your cabinets and the counter is limited. On the Keurig-ish side, the water must be refilled for every cup you make which differs from most Keurig units. It's a little off-putting but not a dealbreaker. I also wish that the power cord were a little longer. The biggest tip I can offer is to set the strength to 'regular' and keep it there. For some reason, the bold setting doesn't quite operate as well. You'd be better off using bold coffee than trusting the 'Brew Strength' button. Another pitfall is that the Keurig side takes a little longer to brew than your standard Keurig machine so be patient.

I have not yet brewed using the carafe side, only the single serve, but I have brewed both Donut Shop coffee and Swiss Miss hot chocolate K-cups, and hot tea using the brewer basket. I am VERY impressed so far! The manufacturers have thought of just about everything! It's very user-friendly, and I love that the drip tray is removable so you can easily switch from a coffee cup to a travel mug, and I love that the drip tray also acts as storage for the brew basket or K-cup holder thing-y when not in use. It keeps all the parts together which is great! I also LOVE that the single-serve option has a Bold option for brewing. I never bought a Keurig because the coffee always tastes so weak to me, but brewing Bold on this machine is a game-changer. The only thing that is somewhat of a nuisance on this machine is that I have to scoot the entire machine out to be able to pour water into the reservoir because the reservoir is on top towards the back of the machine, and my machine sits under my cabinets on the kitchen counter, and the cabinets are too low for me to be able to fill the machine without having to move it back and forth. But that is really not a big deal to me in the long run and not really the company's fault! I bought this machine because I like the flexibility of being able to brew a large pot of coffee for company and just a single cup for myself in the morning rush without having to clean a big carafe for just one cup. This seems to be the workhorse of a 2-in-1 coffee brewing system, and at a reasonable price point in my opinion. It also looks nice on the kitchen counter.

My honest answer after using it for 2 weeks. Don't hesitate. I'll list Pro's and Con's and you decided on your own. Pro's: 1. One coffee maker instead of 2. See, number 4 2. Uses K-cups or use the separate filter for your own. (Very easy to use and clean) 3. Try and start a brew cycle for single serve with no water in the tank, it will let you know. (oops) 4. Yea, it's larger than your average coffee pot....guess what Negative Rocket scientists, it's replacing 2 Pots. 5. Easy to use controls. 6. Cheap enough Con's 1. I hate a 2 hour hot plate shut off....personal thing, add 1/2 cup water and start again. It's gone before it shuts off again. 2. Ain't got no more Other comments: Top fill requires you to move it out if under low cabinets to fill (a great hardship to some, I just slide it forward, fill and slide back). It's not as fast as a K-machine.....oh, for pete's sake people, it's not a K machine!!!! Keep your old K machine and buy a coffee machine in addition if you can't wait about 2-3 minutes for coffee. I have to fill it every time for a single cup......more trauma for some. Personally, I like fresh water better than water that's been sitting in a machine or tank till ready to use. If you really want to you can fill it up with it's 8-10oz and leave it, machine knows the difference between pot and single. Coffee flavor......tastes like coffee, all subjective, if yours is to weak, get a stronger kind, again not Rocket Science. I can't taste any difference between Regular and Strong, again subjective. Hey, at the price you can't beat it. Cheaper than a K machine and if unhappy with speed and size go for the $199.00 Silver Cuisiexpensive. That's about it, other than the longevity test...... ****UPDATE**** 8 months later I had to buy another coffee pot. Out of the blue it decides to blow the tops off the pods and give me coffee grinds all over. Doesn't matter what kind of Pod. Tried everything, Cleaned it, flipped gasket seal....same!

I love the fact that the pot of coffee stays hot for 2 hours. The coffee from either of the methods provides a much better tasting cup than ever came out of our Keurig's. It takes a little longer to make and a smidge more effort, but so worth it! I'm saving the planet one pod at a time... and we're enjoying better coffee while doing so! I highly, highly, highly recommend this coffee maker! You'll love it!",I can't say enough good things about this coffee maker,Amazon,4

The water access is easy. The lid to access the K cup is well hinged; it stays in place when fully open and there's no doubt when it's completely closed and is ready for brewing. The selection buttons (to brew the side you are using) are very easy to use. In fact, there's only one button to press to brew the single cup side after you've poured a cup of water and placed it onto the elevated pedestal. The pedestal also functions as an overflow sump if you forget to put your coffee cup in place or to store the loose coffee holder when using the single cup holder (or vice versa I assume). Finally, my experience has been that when a single cup has brewed, there are no drips following the final dispensing noise; then the brew indicator light on the panel goes off within a second or so. The only feature missing on this model, which I would like to have, is a light that comes on during brewing and dispensing which allows me to see into my cup. I had this feature on a Remington iCoffee brewer that I used right before this Hamilton Beach unit. The light is not necessary if there is no dripping following the completion of brewing/dispensing, but I did get used to easily seeing into the otherwise dark cup before removing it from the pedestal.",The water access is easy.

I switched over from a Hamilton Beach automatic drip machine, prior to that  Starbucks espresso machine and prior to that a french press.  I love making Lattes with real frothed milk but it is just too time consuming early in the morning before work. The single brew side: I have had no experience with Keurig machines so the time it takes to brew a single cup and the fact that you have to fill the water reservoir each time doesn't bother me.  The single cup function works great,  it is easy to use, simple to clean up and the coffee tastes great.  I've been brewing Starbucks French Roast K-cups set on the bold setting with 14 oz of water.  The flavor is just like a cup of french press coffee but without the thickness you get using a coffee press, which I don't mind.  I tried the latte pods which work fine in the machine but  are far too sweet and not surprisingly quite far off from a tradition lattes flavor.  The hot cocoa pods work great!  I bought those for my husband so he could try out the machine since he is not a coffee drinker.  I recommend following the instructions with the non coffee pods and running a cup of water after using cocoa or latte pods, so to not taint your coffee pods when brewed. The coffee pot:  I haven't used this yet,  so I'll update my rating when I do. I give this machine 5 stars for now.  If the coffee pot functions as well as the single brew I'm sure my rating will stay the same. When I used the coffee pot I will update my review.",Great multi purpose machine!,Amazon,1

The mid-day conundrum is this: sometimes our large drip coffeemaker is empty by the time she leaves for work. I could use just one more cup. What to do? The Hamilton Beach Flexbrew 2-Way Brewer tries to respond to that need without putting two completely different appliances on my kitchen counter. This is both a 12-cup drip coffeemaker and a single-serving K cup-compatible brewer. It is perfectly capable of addressing the situation I mention above. Of course, it IS two completely different appliances, wedded into the same housing. Hamilton Beach's marketing department must have had some issues explaining it. The control panel at left has icons (no words) incised into the buttons. The first thing you find when you open the box is a slip of paper that offers a legend explaining what each of those buttons does. The tray under the single-serve spout doubles as a storage space for the Kcup holders (there are two: regular and reusable)—and the marketers discovered they had to put a sticker on that one as well, because there are two covers over the storage space. My reaction to this machine is that it looks like a 'camel' (a horse designed by a committee, in Samuel Clemens' unforgettable phrase). HB did its best to make it work, but it just seems like an awkward solution. You choose one side or the other to make your brew. The Kcup side does not hold a reservoir of water as most single-cup brewers would, but instead expects you to use the serving cup to fill it with just enough water for that cup. Since some of the water does not dispense at the other end, you'll always be just a bit low on beverage when you're done. And, that serving cup had better be clean: the marketing department had to add a warning on the reservoir lid not to run coffee through the single-serve system. The display is clean and useful, the reusable baskets for both sides are welcome, and we will enjoy this brewer. But I still have the image of a camel in mind when I recommend that you consider carefully whether this one large machine will really save space on your counter. I expect some users will prefer flexibility in their kitchen layout.","Sally the Camel rides again! Overall a good coffeemaker, ironically takes some supplemental explaining",Amazon,0

Cleaning doesn't help despite the devices constant nagging for one--which continues even after you clean it.  It has a 5 year warranty, but why bother?  At this rate I'm going to need to send it back to the factory 15 times over that five years just to keep coffee flowing, and I'm thinking that replacing it is a better option, because who needs that hassle?

It's served me well for a couple months now and I really like the ability to combine single serve or full pot functionality in one. Most of the time I only make two cups a day so K-cups are handy. Sometimes when more people visit I use the pot. And you can brew a single serving with your favorite coffee grinds too since it has a basket that can replace the K-cup holder for single serve drip coffee. It's true that the single serve side requires you to refill with each brew; that took some getting used to after having a different K-cup machine, but I adjusted and don't even think about it now. One important note: some have complained about the K-cups exploding in this machine during the brewing process and making a mess. That has happened to me, though it is not often and not with all K-cups. After observing the malfunctioning K-cups I think what is happening is that the seal at the top of the K-cup breaks under the pressure of the injected hot water, and the grinds and water escape from that rupture. It is indeed a messy hassle, but I've had it happen so far with a few types of K-cup: - Sam's Club decaf, about one out of every 18 cups - McCafe Premium Brew (medium), so far just once Still, this never happened with my other machines and I wanted to know why. So I studied the needle mechanism on the Flexbrew. It has a small circular rubber washer that forms a seal where the needle punctures the K-cup foil top. Because it's applying pressure on the center of the K-cup top, it leaves the edges vulnerable to rupture. My old Keurig had a different mechanism that clamped down on the entire top of the K-cup and that may be the difference with weaker K-cups. This is just conjecture on my part, I am not a coffee machine physicist and cannot say for sure this is the cause. However, I am curious if the manufacturer of this machine could try a different design of the rubber washer (perhaps wide enough to cover the entire K-cup top and thereby reinforce the edges)? And maybe send the updated part to owners? Anyway, I'm just corroborating what some other reviews saw. It does happen but for me has been infrequent. I otherwise really like this coffee maker. Edit: updated frequency of issues with the Sam's Decaf, and also dropped rating a star for the piss-poor response from the manufacturer.

It would also stop brewing full cups of coffee. In researching a new coffee maker, I was looking for a smaller pot but no more k-cups. They aren’t recyclable and I’m tired of not knowing if there’s mold lurking in the water storage area. To my surprise, I found this gem. It’s two in one (full pot plus single serve options AND K-cup insert attachment) features end up being the ideal coffee service station for my needs. There are two of us who drink coffee in the morning, so the single serve cup maker is great for that. In addition, when we have guests, we can make a pot for 12 when needed. Then, the added bonus is the k-cup attachment for when my in-laws come over. I keep some decaf k-cups for them.

I did order #1 coffee filters for the single, as cleaning the filter when putting grounds directly into the container is very messy.  I find Kcups to be expensive and a waste of plastic, so I will pretty much use my own grounds.  One thing:  all my kitchen space where I would place this rather large machine requires it to fit under cupboards.  This means I have to slide the machine out every time I want to use it, and that is awkward.

So this seemed like a perfect replacement for the two coffee pots we've had sitting on our kitchen counter for the past year. :)  My son has an older Hamilton Beach Flexbrew and loves it, so we decided to give it a shot. I bought model 49976 which I think is currently the newest model. So far so good!  We love the flexibility of being able to brew a single cup/mug, or an entire pot. And being able to use K-cups if desired is a nice bonus!  I would have given it 5-stars except for two small gripes... 1) It would be nice if the carafe warming plate would remain on when you use the single-brew side. But as soon as you flip over to single-brew, it turns off the carafe side completely, even if you just finished brewing a full pot of coffee! Hamilton Beach could vastly improve the design by including a button to turn the carafe warming plate on/off, with an auto-shutoff after a certain amount of time.  And 2), the single-serve brew basket seems to let a lot of coffee ground 'residue' through into my cup. I can't stand coffee grit in the bottom of my cup. I grind my coffee fresh, so I'm going to play around with the coarseness of the grind to see if I can eliminate that problem. UPDATE: So apparently after using the single-serve side, you can switch back over to carafe and hit the brew button to turn the warming plate back on. If there's no water in the carafe side, it just turns the plate back on and doesn't try to brew anything. Nice!",Genius idea for a coffee pot! Design could be improved slightly.,Amazon,79

Started pouring scaling hot water out of the bottom. Hamilton Beach had the nerve to charge me $12-13 to ship a new one out. I guess $12 is better than not having a coffee maker, but this is the last straw with Hamilton Beach. Their products just haven't cut it for me. Original Review: My last review of the Hamilton Beach received nearly 1000 upvotes and dozens of “thank you” comments. They mainly stemmed from the shortcomings of the old 49983 version and the manual MacGuyvering you had to do to eat it to function correctly. The old version had one reservoir. If you wanted more than 8oz or so of coffee you had to rig up a stick to keep a sensor pushed down. It was a serious design flaw and a general pain. I’m glad Hamilton Beach listened and applied some updates to this new model! Two tanks means you can brew your single-serve/k-cup without worrying about it the carafe tank is already full of water. The K-cup insert storage in the base is wonderful from a design and convenience perspective. The single serve side is not as fast as a true Keurig, but that’s to be expected. The carafe side makes delicious coffee and I was pleased to see the return of the regular/bold setting. The new display is much more pleasing to the eye and doesn’t have those ridiculously bright green and blue indicator lights the old model had. A very nice improvement. My last FlexBrew lasted 4 wonderful years. It was finally looking rough: reservoir lid was falling off, heat plate was corroding. If this had been the initial model, I believe more people would’ve raved about it. TL:DR - this is the model we all wanted initially. It’s perfect for those who don’t use k-cups all the time and need that option. I’m incredibly pleased and will post updates if they’re needed.",Take 2... Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Review,Amazon,15

When the machine is set to bold single serve it makes a wonderful bold brew that is not bitter and is very smooth.   The details on the machine are really nice. Easy to see water gauges, the pot pours easily with no dripping, great storage so there aren't extra pieces being lost, and the display face is easy to see without being overly bright and showy.

This new coffee maker started major leaking yesterday.  We tried it again this morning and again it leaked all over the countertop.  So - this time it lasted 4 months before leaking.  It would be interesting to know how many initial happy reviewers have since had this problem with leaking. It's typical to leave a review after a few days, before a unit has been thoroughly tested.  Anyway, today the second coffee maker goes back to the big box store (I was cautious enough to save my box and packaging after the first disaster). Seriously Hamilton Beach -  accept this design flaw, spend a little money on R&D, correct it, and then market a coffee maker that will leave your competition scrambling.  If you'll read through the reviews on Amazon, you'll see at least one reviewer appears to have identified the problem, so most of your work is done for you. Disappointing to say the least. First Review: Used this model 49976 for 3 months and loved it.  Then it started leaking water massively from the bottom of the unit.  I'm going to return it to the big box store for a refund.  I really liked it, so I'm going to purchase again and try it one more time.  If that one fails, it's going back too.

You couldn't get the smallest Keurig at that price.  So I'm pretty impressed that it takes the single serve pods, but there is a basket to directly put your coffee grounds in.  There's also a clock and you can set a time to brew in the morning.  I'm no coffee connoisseur, but the coffee is good & hot.  I like my coffee strong & always used the bold setting. I read a complaint about not being able to use a reusable gold filter and that you had to use paper filters.  The machine comes with a reusable mesh filter. It comes with a separate attachment in order to use pods, but no place to store it, which is no big deal, but it has a sharp blade. The newer model now has a storage place built in. You have to be careful about using the correct amount of water.  The water container is NOT a reservoir.  If you make a single cup, you can only put in the same amount of water as your cup. I loved this machine & it worked great up until the day after the 1 year warranty was up! The single serve side no longer dripped water.  It seemed there was either a hole in the tube or the tube was loose.  However, I still bought a replacement.  If this next one dies again, I've seen (after having made my replacement purchase) that Ninja & Cuisinart have similar models.  It's double the price, but I've already spent the same amount.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:really wanted to give this product a good review.  At first we LOVED it.  It was great having the carafe and k-cup option.  However, the machine broke in less than 3 months.  The holding tank on the carafe side would hold water when the machine was off, but when you attempted to brew a pot, the entire tank leaked out onto the counter.  It seems like the water line that pumps the water from the holding tank up to the grounds must have broken, but I can't be sure without taking the entire thing apart.  I am still giving the product two stars because Hamilton Beach is replacing the product with no hassle/free shipping/no cost.  Unfortunately it's now on back order so I'm stuck waiting 2-3 weeks for the replacement.  Good thing I stored my old coffee pot just in case, or I'd be out the expense of buying something in the interim.  Hopefully this was a fluke and the new machine doesn't conk out after 3 months.

My biggest complaint with my previous keurig is that my coffee or teas never seems hot. After adding a little creamer it's already colder than room temperature. This is steaming hot, which is perfect for me. My only complaint. Is that I find it silly with the water reservoir business. If I had known I might have not purchased it.

I got so sick of having mediocre cups of coffee with my K-cup brewer, and what I originallly thought was the convenience of owning a Keurig brewer, has ultimately become such an annoyance.  I have become so disenchanted with the whole waste of the K-cups, not to mention the cost - but I didn't want to give it up entirely, as there are many mornings when I only want one cup of coffee, or after entertaining, I have one guest who wants one cup of coffee!  Enter the Hamilton Beach Flex Brew! This machine makes great coffee (at least I think so)!  The single brew side works great with either fresh ground or a K-cup!  And the K-cup coffee tasted much better coming from this machine than in the Keurig brewer!  Even my husband, who is a coffee snob, say she likes the coffee much better from this machine!  Is this coffee boutique coffee tasting?  No - but this machine isn't intended for those high pressure types of coffee experiences.  It's more of a drip coffee experience. Here are some cons: - The machine does take a while to brew, on both sides.  You're not going to get that instant cup of coffee that the K-cup only brewers provide - but - I have found that this will just take a little betting used to - and, I am also finding that this machine brews a bit hotter than the K-cup machine - so even if I walk away and it brews while I'm not there - the coffee is still hot when I return! - It will not fit under some cabinets.  It does fit under mine, however, but it is a tiny bit taller than most coffee makers and some people might have a problem with it. Makes sure you measure before purchasing. - The large water reservoir can be a bit tricky to navigate with the carafe, and the angle is a bit awkward.  That last little bit of water can be a bit tricky to get out of the pot if you don't have ample clearance.  Also - it has two separate reservoirs for carafe and single serve.  Some people have complained about having to fill the reservoir every time they brew a cup of coffee on the single side - my answer to that is....use the carafe side!  Even for 4 cups of coffee, it brews a great small pot! - The 'storage' compartment on the single brew side, which lifts the cup up, in my opinion, is a bit too tall.  Works great for smaller coffee cups - but those that are a little taller won't fit - BUT - so far I have not at all experienced sprays or drips coming out of the cup and onto the counter when I have removed the compartment. Pros: - Makes great coffee for this type of brewer!!  I purchased mine at another retail location, and got 20% off with a coupon! - I also purchased a reuseable 'gold' filter for the carafe side - one that has a flat bottom - it works great!  I think it was a Mr. Coffee brand. - Reuseable filter for single brew side!  Works great! Just don't fill it past the 'max' line and you won't have the issues that some people have complained about - grounds coming out of the top! - Super convenient for whatever your coffee/tea needs are!  You can brew a carafe, K-cup, or single serving using grounds. - less waste, less $$ in the long run!!",Brews a GREAT cup of coffee for a drip coffee machine!

But wait, there's more...so much more. My husband loves the single cup option for his morning travel mug and look at how well his mug fits, he doesn't have to tilt cup to get it in and out! It also includes two cups for the single cup side - one for kcups and one for coffee grounds that has the wire screen filter built in. Love it! And to top it off you can store the cup your not using in the base. He also loves that he can get a bold brew or regular brew on the single and carafe side. This is sleek unit and just feels well built, not the usual cheap plastic it seems everything is made of these days. The digital display and programable timer are features he missed in the Keurig and are simple and easy to use. I like the fact that it brews the whatever amount  of water you put in the reservoirs (both single and carafe sides), hate the thought of what grows in water while it sits for days.

You can rest assured that only the water in the single side is being heated and there are no other parts that may burn while using it.

I have tried with lukewarm water instead of cold filtered water. It still takes just as long. I believe it usually takes about 15-20 minutes to get enough to fill my 32ounce mug and then the rest of the pot goes a bit quicker (probably because everything is heated?) I would buy again.

And save the obvious reason—that it can brew both a regular pot of coffee or a single serving using the 'cups' that have taken over the coffee aisle—here's why we love it: - includes a make-your-own 'cup' which is smartly and conveniently stored in the perch under the drip tray on the single-serving side - both piercing units on the single-serving side pop out easily and instantly for cleaning - it uses all the water you supply on the single-serving side - both sides feature very clear water gauges - it's set by default for a two-hour warm and auto shut-off on the regular-pot side (no need to set) - the bold setting stays put if you want—you don't have to push it every time you brew a cup - the clock is beyond easy to set - the regular-pot side uses good ol' round (read: inexpensive) coffee filters - the pot does not drip whatsoever, very sturdy We barely glanced at the instructions, it's that easy. * It's a bit slower than our previous K machine (takes 3 mins 5 secs to brew an 8-oz single cup), but that doesn't bother us because it's more important to us that water doesn't sit in the machine.

To begin with, it's easy to use, use one side or the other. I normally program my carafe side the night before so my coffee is ready in the morning. It's easy enough with this machine. I have not tried to program the single brew side, but I am sure it works well.  My only negative, which probably won't bother most coffee drinkers is that the coffee comes out too hot.  I usually place two ice cubes in my cup when I pour my morning joe.  But that's just me, most people like it hot. The single serve, or k cup side, works great. Because of the modular design of the k cup holder, you just need to make sure when you place the k cup in, that you feel it get punctured by the bottom needle. The top needle does not need much pressure because it only punctures the foil top of the k cups, so just by closing the cover you will be fine. I use the single brew side to brew iced tea. The unit has two different reservoirs, although the k cup side only brews what you put into it, not like most Kurigs that hold extra water. Just pour what you need and it will brew that amount for you.  The height of the k cup side is big enough for my large travel mugs.  I've included some photos, hope they help.

I didn't put any coffee in the K-cup holder for these tests. Temperature measurements were done with a digital cooking thermometer. Coffee times and temperatures for the Single or K-Cup side: 8oz cup (Icewater 41º)  Time to brew through- 2min11sec Water temp. In the cup 167º 8oz cup (Tapwater 80º)  Time to brew through - 1min55sec Water temp. In the cup 170º 8oz cup (Hot Tapwater 120º)  Time to brew through - 1min40sec Water temp. In the cup 170º The temperature of the water pouring out of the K-cup brewsprout was measured at a nominal 190º The temperature of the coffee I found in the 'Carafe' this morning  (Set for automatic brew last night) was 165º During the single cup experiments, turning on the single cup function automatically turned off the carafe function of the coffee maker.  When I was through with a single cup trial, I simply turned the coffee maker back on to carafe and the carafe pot stayed hot. The coffee machine automatically turns off after brewing a single cup. This machine is the answer to all the questions and concerns I've had in getting a K-cup machine. Set it up to automatically make a pot of coffee for the morning or brew a single cup or travel-mug (up to 14 oz.) of coffee anytime. Use it with a standard K-cup, a K-cup pod, or with the single cup strainer, supplied with the machine, to produce a single cup using your own brand of coffee grounds.  The price (at around $80.00 depending where you get it) is reasonable. The coffee maker looks good on the counter and at no more than 12' wide X 11' deep X 13' high, it is not so large that I will complain. I intend to put a K-cup drawer (36 K-cup capacity) under the coffee maker on the counter that will raise the coffee maker approximately 2.5'. So far, I'm a fan of the Flex Brew Coffee Maker.

It's good. I am not sorry for my purchase. But I don't feel like it is 'right' for me but it could be for somebody. So here is what I have to say to see if it jives with you and your life. First, I am a coffee lover. Not a snob, not emphatic, but I love coffee. I drink it black, I can easily drink half a pot in the morning if I don't have to run off to work or anything. The brew on this coffee maker is okay. It doesn't make a bad pot of coffee by any means, but I also don't think there is anything spectacular about it either. I'm still playing with the subtleties of making my perfect pot, but it seems selecting the bold brew helps (I presume it heats the water a bit hotter than standard brew). I feel the opening at the top for the water reservoir is good, with plenty of space to pour the water in. I feel the carafe itself feels solid and pours well. The overall design of the pot is decently thought out and feels good. Most of my negatives have to do with the single brew side (which I will get to momentarily). There are two tiny things I wish were available on this model. One, I wish the power plug was at a 90 degree angle instead of a standard straight plug. Being so big and so wide it will go in front of my socket...which I don't mind if I could slide it all the way back to the wall but the plug gets in the way. Two, where's the white model? There isn't an option for that. But all of my appliances are white so it would be nice to have things match. A related potential 'negative' I would say is that if you want to get a gold mesh permanent filter for the main brewer, it doesn't seem to fit well. They are fairly small and sit low in the normal plastic 'basket' area where you put the paper filter. I find using a paper filter alone is far easier and more convenient. No big deal in the end, but I felt I should mention it because I thought I could get a permanent filter and have it be a nice match. The single cup side (keurig style) is a nice addition...with some caveats. It is part of the reason I chose this coffee maker, wanting that fast option if I only had time for 1 cup...or wanted to take it with me. It works, and I like the fact that it comes with it's own permanent gold mesh filter if you want to not use an actual k-cup or other brand (and yes, it will take any brand you buy at the market). That filter fits in the base under the single brew side (which holds the mug up high for less splatter or you can remove it if you are brewing into a tall travel mug). I nit pick that putting the filter back into the storage area is not convenient. It fits very precisely into the open space, so if it is off a millimeter then the container won't close. Not the end of the world but far more frustrating than it needs to be. There is a separate water reservoir for the single brew side, which is fine. It would have been cool to have a single water source, but that's not a big deal in my mind. What IS a big deal in my mind is that whatever water you put into that reservoir will brew. So you can't figure you are going to make 2 cups, one for you and one for somebody else and fill it 16oz. You have to fill 8oz (or whatever your desired amount) let that water heat, then brew your cup, then fill another 8oz of water and let that heat and then brew the second cup. It would have been far more convenient to have the entire water heat, then be able to select your cup size, oz of water to brew with, etc... like you can on an actual Keurig machine. It pretty much makes the single brew side literally a single brew side. You can basically use it one way, and one way only. That is a pretty bad design in my mind and removes the convenience of having that side built in. At the end of the day, it works. All of it is totally functional and I am not dissatisfied, but I am not totally satisfied either. The machine is big and takes up a lot of counter space, so for that amount of real estate I would probably rather have a separate pot brewer and single brewer machine and get better versions of both.",Decent. I like it. I don't love it or hate it.,Amazon,355

The only negative is this is a traditional maker meaning you need to fill the water for each single and/or carafe.

So when our latest coffee maker suddenly stopped producing coffee, and we saw this new model, we bought it immediately, and are really hoping that along with changing the appearance, Hamilton Beach has upgraded the quality and workmanship of this product.  Time will tell.  At this point, I would have only two negatives to report, the first being its size.  It is quite a bit larger than the previous model, and takes up more counter space.  Secondly, I've found that when making a carafe of coffee, I have to use more coffee than I did in the previous model to get the coffee strength that we want, even on the 'bold' setting.

Not only can you make a 12-cup pot of coffee, but also a single cup. Unfortunately, I came across a few annoyances: First, it’s tall. Over 14” on the high (right) side. The distance from my counters to the cabinets above is 18”. That does not leave enough room for opening the lids and pouring water from the coffee pot or single cup. If you are setting this on a surface without cabinets above, or you happen to have a taller space between counter and cabinets (such as in an office building), then this won’t be an issue for you. For me, it’s annoying because I have to scoot the entire pot forward every time I want to use it. Sure, I could leave it out toward the edge of my counter, but that not only looks ridiculous, but leaves an obnoxious empty space behind it. Keep in mind it's pretty wide and deep too (around 11' square), so you'll need a fair amount of room on your countertops. Second, the K-Cup single-serve feature isn’t nearly as efficient as it is on a regular Keurig. While I like the ability to put a larger cup and even a travel mug underneath, the brew time is extremely slow. On my Cuisinart Single Serve Brewing System, it takes 1.18 minutes to heat the water and 17 seconds to finish pouring. That’s 1.35 total (just over a minute and a half). On my Keurig Single Serve Coffee Maker, it takes 1.25 minutes total. The Hamilton Beach Flex brew? It takes 2.06 minutes to heat the water, and another 39 second to finish pouring; that’s 2.45 minutes total (over a minute longer). If I run the single-serve, walk out the room, and come back, that’s not so bad. But when I’m standing there waiting for it, that extra minute+ gets annoying. And it’s not like the machine is heating more water to justify the extra time—its max reservoir is the same as the others: 10 oz. Another difference I don’t like is with the K-Cup baskets the Hamilton Beach uses. Unlike  standard K-Cup holders , this one uses its own style. There are two different pieces: the gray single-serve pack holder and the black funnel that goes underneath. Why does that matter? Two reasons: (1) When I’m brewing a K-Cup, I’ve come to enjoy the froth it leaves at the top. However, with the HB (Hamilton Beach), at least half the froth gets trapped in the funnel; it never gets into the cup. (2) The two-piece system the HB uses requires you to rinse it after every use. More stain and buildup collects in the funnel than it does on a standard K-Cup holder. Sure, you don’t have to wash it every time, but you do have to clean it more frequently. These things are why I rate this system 3-stars. On Amazon, 3-stars means “It’s okay.” Because honestly, even with those annoyances, the coffee maker is still okay. There are features I like, such as the single-serve brew basket, taller cup rest, cord stuff storage, brew strength setting, and water windows. It just wasn’t a good fit for my setup or expectations.",Slow single-serve and doesn’t work well under cabinets,Amazon,264

We were previously using another Hamilton Beach Flex Brew system that did not allow k-cups. For starters, the carafe side makes a great pot of coffee. The machine must be pulled out from under my upper cabinetry to fill with water. This is something that has to be done with most coffee makers, but this Flex Brew model is so large and monstrous that even pulled to the edge of the counter, the lid doesn't open all the way, making filling the reservoir located at the very back of the machine awkward. I often dripped water into the coffee grounds. The single serving side is a great idea...in fact, we really liked the single serve side on our previous Flex Brew model. However, we found the coffee made on this machine was inconsistent. The included inserts allow you to easily use k-cups or your own grounds. Although you have the convenience of using k-cups with this machine, it is not like most Keurigs. You must fill the single-serve side reservoir with water EACH time you want a cup. This is not that big of a deal, but if you're used to the instant gratification of a genuine Keurig...well, it'll take a bit more labor on your part with the Flex Brew. Using k-cups usually made a good cup of coffee with this machine. IF you did not change the brew strength to 'BOLD.' You would think that the 'bold' option would give you bold coffee...not so. Each time we used this brew setting, we ended up with a watery cup o' joe. Blech. On the 'regular' setting, the k-cup coffee turned out (mostly) as expected. When using our own grounds, we had better results, again - as long as we kept the brew setting to 'regular.' So, generally, the machine does what it says. It just needs a little time to adjust to and plenty of room on your countertop.","Jack of all trades, master of...some?",Amazon,376

The dual capacity is very handy to be sure. There are some things I really like about this appliance and a few things I'm not so crazy about. Pros: 1.You can make a full carafe of coffee or just a single cup. This is great for parties and gatherings because those who like decaf or even tea can have their beverages while the majority get their coffee. 2. Brew strength - You have the ability to brew coffee at regular or bold strength. 3. You can use k-cups or regular coffee in the single cup side. A mini-filter is included and there is storage in the unit for it when not needed. Cons 1. Not the sturdiest plastic I've seen 2. The directions are confusing. I had to run through them a few times before I could brew a cup of coffee without thinking too hard about it. 3. The single cup size does not have a large tank but it is larger than the 10 oz. recommended per mug of coffee. Whatever you pour in is coming out when you hit brew. Do not overfill or you will be mopping up watery coffee off the counter. If the pros outweigh the cons for you, this could be a good purchase. I do like my brewer and I'm glad I have it.

I'm now a fan of this coffee maker that serves my husband and me each morning and gives me 12 oz of an afternoon cup.  Providing a 2-in-1 unit needs to be larger than the standard maker and I'm impressed that Hamilton Beach designed smartly. Our coffee maker needs to park under upper shelves--which this one does easily at 14' tall.  We've been using a 'handy caddy' pull-out under our makers for a long time.  (Saved our wood counter tops for years...and now provides a smooth glide forward/back on tile)  Both water-well lids require open space above, so we pull our brewer forward.  While forward, the Hamilton Beach needs a big footprint... approx 12' left-to-right and 22' front-to-back.  The good news, is that the top of the maker doesn't get as hot and steamer as our older coffee makers, so once the coffee is brewed, I can slide it back to its parking spot under the counter. Preparing coffee by either option is simple, straight-forward, and effective.  There's ample room in both for pouring and I haven't dribbled/spilled trying to navigate a too-small space.  Very pleased by this positive feature for me. I am in a lot of homes who have higher end coffee makers--lots of Keurigs.  It's a large piece of counter-top gear too and I wouldn't trade this 2-option Hamilton Beach for a Keurig.  For me, it feels wasteful to whip through the K-cups and I've yet to find the right ratio for my ground coffee in the 'do it yourself pod'.  But, for an afternoon mug, I easily justify one K-cup in my favorite dark roast. Design: Carafe Side:  The buttons over the carafe are clear and simple.  The carafe slides in and out smoothly (no tugging or tipping to pull out or return).  The coffee is very hot (a plus).  The ground basket lifts out easily and the water well is ample for me to pour water without spilling/dripping/dribbling. Individual cup Side:  A step-stool design to (a) store do it yourself pods or a k-cup doubles as a cup rest for your cup of coffee.  This riser easily lifts out if (a) you want to retrieve/replace or (b) you have a tall travel mug.  Mine is 7 3/4' tall -- I do have to slightly angle it under the dispenser, but I found that smooth. The finish is done in a black matte which better camouflages finger prints (than shiny).  The back (black) cord is (approx) 21' long, so ... probably like most coffee makers, it needs to be nearer an outlet (to provide for pulling it out to pour water if under upper cabinets). What impressed me a lot, about the single-cup, is how much better tasting and stronger my usual K-cup brand came out (12 oz amount)...and hotter... than the Keurigs I have used.  (I know the temperature can be adjusted on the Keurig and even then... this H-Beach without adjusting the temperature...was hotter).  The carafe side also puts out a smooth and hot(ter) cup of coffee than our former HB coffee maker. Notes: This brewer does not beep when done (which I have no worries that I'll forget to check)--I prefer 'no beep' For a 10 cup carafe; 9minutes 38 seconds. For a 12 oz travel mug; 3 minutes. The carafe side 'noise' seems standard--with a lean to more quiet than many past makers. The K-Cup side is louder, which is expected--but this isn't an issue for me--short cycle to heat and dispense. Each side has its own exterior-viewing water-level gauge Two-hour keep warm cycle Programmable (which I don't use) The only 'con' I have witnessed is that there are a few (3) drips when the individual 'K cup' is 'done'.

You can adjust this of course to a smaller size. The other side of the machine is for s regular carafe of coffee which holds up to 12 cups of water. This side also has its own water reservoir. I have used this to make all three types of coffee and all of them have been strong enough, taste wonderful, and easy to brew. You just choose which side you are brewing and hit brew now. You can also set a timer so your coffee brews at a designated time. This feature we use for our morning coffee so it is ready when we wake up for work in the morning.

I also like the holder for single cup ground coffee better (make sure you do NOT fill above the Max line with grounds). For the k-cup and ground coffee this maker seems to have more pressure. You can brew BOLD on the single side as well as the carafe side. Under the single side the platform for a cup also holds the single ground coffee holder. It just lifts off to use a tall cup. The single side is so easy to clean and with the tab, it is easier to empty a hot K-cup without burning your fingers. The ONLY problem I have ever had, is the printing on the buttons, they labels easily wipe off.",Best Hamilton Beach with carafe yet!,Amazon,425

2871,Hamilton Beach,"April 18, 2017","Hamilton Beach (49976) FlexBrew Coffee Maker, Single Serve & Full Coffee Pot, Compatible with Single-Serve Pods or Ground Coffee, Programmable, Black",B06Y2WCHDV,4,"My Keurig has got one foot in the grave, and I have been looking for a new coffeemaker. I love the convenience and speed of the Keurig, but I miss the better flavor that a drip maker gives. I hand't really thought of a combination coffeemaker until I saw this from Hamilton Beach. After several days of being able to make a full pot of coffee that has taken it's time brewing instead of being rushed through stale grounds in pre-packaged K-cups. I forgot how good the coffee oils are! Pros: ======== - Brew one serving or a whole pot of coffee. - The basket for using your own ground coffee for the K-cup side. This thing is ingenious!  Much tastier than a typical pre-packaged K-pod. - Programmable brew time so that you have either a pot or single cup of coffee ready for you in the morning. - The longer brew time means a better cup of coffee. Coffee needs at least four minutes in contact with the water to brew properly, and that's one reason why K-pods taste so weak. The brew time is far too short (though there are ways to increase it for a better cup of coffee using a Keurig/K-pod machine) - Allows for an even slower brew option for a stronger cup or pot of coffee. - Storage compartment in the back for the cord when unplugged. - Storage under the K-cup side for the interchangeable filter and pod holder pieces so they don't get lost when not being used. - Full sized coffee pot with a secure handle. - You coffee pot will be kept warm by the bottom plate for about two hours at which time the coffeemaker shuts itself off. - Easy to clean - pretty much everything but the water tanks are removable for cleaning. Hand washing is usually better as even washing on the top rack of the dishwasher can degrade the plastic parts or warp them. - Easy to set up and program the clock and brew timer. - The little storage block underneath the K-cup side comes out so you can brew directly into a travel mug. - Detailed, step-by-step directions that include a troubleshooting guide, part descriptions, brewing tips, and how to keep your coffeemaker in the best possible condition. - Two hour automatic shutoff so you never have to worry about leaving it on when you have to run out of the house in the mornings. - Footprint is the same size as my Keurig. Cons ======== - Two separate water tanks to clean. Why separate water tanks? That just makes something extra to clean. - It can take several minutes for the water to heat up for brewing versus the almost instant ready status of my Keurig. There is no instant cup of life in the morning unless you set the programmable brew time. - I have NEVER seen such a short power cord on an appliance! Because of such as short power cord, this coffeemaker has to be positioned right in front of a plug. If you use a coffee cart like I do, there's a big chance that the cord won't reach the outlet so you will need a power strip extension cord to plug this in to. - No internal water filter like the Keurig has. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but it helps keep down the scaling and schmuck inside the coffeemaker. - Has anyone ever given you a small gift that was stuck inside multiple bigger and bigger boxes? That's how this thing was shipped. It shouldn't take three additional boxes and packing to put around the original box the coffeemaker is in. - Hamilton Beach was a little stingy when it came to products to support their coffeemaker. Every other coffeemaker I've purchased has come with at least two or three paper filters (so you know which to buy), a mini/sample container of descaling treatment, etc. - Not one of the newer coffeemakers out there that you can operate using an app on your phone. - If you have been using plastic refillable/reusable pods with your Keurig, be aware that they WILL NOT work with this machine. The way the puncturing pins are positioned prevents the lid from closing if you try to use one of these reusable pods, which stinks. The reusable filter that H. B. provides with the machine actually brews better coffee than the reusable pods do with the Keurig, so the 'con' here is now you have more useless stuff to put in your junk drawer. You can still use the smaller, one time use fillable paper K-filters, though. Only time will tell if this coffeemaker lasts as long as my Keurig has (going on seven years!), but I hope it does. It's nice to have the choice/ability to brew as little or as much coffee as I'd like without having to guesstimate the right amount of grounds to use so I only brew a two cup pot of coffee. My French press is still the top of the hill, but having a full size, regular brew coffee maker is a nice second. For the price, I'd have to say this is a pretty good bargain.",Nice to have brewing options,Amazon,31

It’s great that you can order the capsules from Amazon but you can sign up for the Nespresso club (In my opinion the capsules are really not that expensive. I purchased a starter package that has a sample of every capsule for the Vertuo line. 100 capsules for a little over $100.00).

I first ran into this machine at an AirBnb in Canada.  I love a cup of good coffee in the morning and was somewhat perplexed when I saw this gizmo in the kitchen (along with a handful of capsules).  With no instructions in sight, I hit Youtube for guidance.  Frankly, I thought it was going to make a horrible cup of java... Wow, was I pleasantly surprised! When I got home to the United States I just had to have one.  My timing isn't normally good, but I lucked out and hit it on sale at Amazon for $99 (including the sampler coffee kit).  I've now had the unit for two months and couldn't be happier.  The chrome version looks great on my counter!  My favorite flavors are Odacio and Melozio.  I drink a cup or two a day.  Yes, it isn't the cheapest coffee, but bang for the buck I consider it a reasonable treat.  My local Sonoma and Williams store sells the machine and graciously gave me some official Nespresso recycle bags. I like a piping hot cup of coffee with half and half cream.  I read a number of reviews complaining about luke warm coffee.  The solution is actually very simple.  You can pre-warm the machine.  Simply press the start button while the handle is in the 'neutral' position or the top of the machine is lifted into the open position.  The machine will stay on for I believe 9 minutes.  In that time the heating element warms up (the top of the machine will be quite warm to the touch).  After that, simply brew yourself a steaming hot cup of coffee.  I'm not sure why the manufacturer doesn't recommend this option. My kitchen is a lot cleaner now that I'm not using my old basket-style drip coffee maker (although I diligently compost).  I don't miss washing and drying the coffee pot.  I've re-ordered Nespresso capsules a couple of times through Amazon.  They typically arrive the next day.

I was first introduced to it in a hotel room and immediately put it on my Mother’s Day wishlist. There were a few things that convinced me that I had to have this. First, I always loved the ease of a Kurig but didn’t like the fact that it the pods weren’t recycleable. Nespresso has found a solution to that and they recycle the pod and the coffee. They provide a bag you can either drop off at a participating store or mail back to them. Second, the frothy foam. Hello?!?! This is it people. It takes about 1 minute and 15 seconds and just one push of a button to have a delicious cup of coffee with frothy foam. And it costs about $1.10 per cup. I only drink one cup a day and I make my daughter 1 cup of espresso each day, so it’s not too costly. If you live in a household that drinks a ton of coffee you might want to factor in the cost of the pods. Lastly, the only cons here are as other reviewers have said, the coffee does not brew super hot. To fix this I simply heat my water on a kettle first, then pour it into the water reservoir. It’s an extra step, but worth it. Also, the cord to run the machine is bulky, understandably so. I use the framed picture on my counter to hide it. Lastly, the machine is a little loud when it brews, but honestly it’s barely worth mentioning. The pros definitely outweigh the cons here. Also, I have used other Nespresso models, which I liked, I still prefer this one the best.  I literally tell everyone who loves coffee to get one of these and I always serve it to my guests with rave reviews!",Coffee AND Espresso Bliss!!!,Amazon,0

So I actively avoided Nespresso machines when shopping for an espresso machine for the house. But eventually the reviews won me over and I decided to give it a shot. So glad I did. This thing has become a fixture in our kitchen and is now deeply integrated in both my and my girlfriend's daily routine. So here's the things that stand out to me as reasons why you'd want one of these: 1) It's reliable - We've been though over 100 pods and not one jam, not one wasted pod. Given my experience w/my office nespresso needless to say I was very impressed 2) It's FAST - heats up in 5 seconds flat and is ready to go. Easily 5x faster than our Keurig. 3) Crema for days - the luxuriously thick crema this thing produces for both espressos and larger coffees is even better than your local coffee house. Seriously. If you are a 'texture person' this is as good as it gets. 4) It's tasty - decent variety of available pods (but see below) and generally high quality - both my GF and I really enjoy the coffee (though we like different styles) 5) It's (sorta) environmentally friendly - at least more so than the Keurig. Pods are all aluminum and fully recycleable and Nespresso provides post-paid bags - just dump your used pods and drop them in the mail (* but see below) 6) It's low-maintenance - super easy to clean and maintain 7) It's versatile - while I use it mainly for espresso, it handles 5 different types/sizes of coffee and all of them we tried came out great And a few things that could stand to be improved upon: 1) The coffee selection is not as varied at it would appear - there are over a dozen varieties, but in reality a lot of them are very similar and are just slightly different blends of the same few beans. If you tend to prefer darker roasts that trend toward the bitter side, you'll find a lot to like. If you like milder roasts you may want to try a few of the varieties before taking the plunge. 2) Unlike with Nespresso original machines, there are not any third party coffee companies that make Vertuo pods - So for the time being anyway you are stuck with what Nespresso offers 3) Pods are on the pricey side - expect to spend about $1/pod 4) Recycling program is great BUT while the bags are technically 'free' - no bags are provided with the machine and to get them you have to place an order of $50+ on Nespresso.com - and that's the only way you can get them. 5) As some reviewers have noted this machine produces coffee at perfect 'ready to drink' temperature. It also produces all sizes and varieties with a thick crema on top. This is by design and in line with European coffee tradition. If you prefer American style coffee and like it piping hot you should buy a Keurig (seriously - we have both and use both and for a good ole black coffee the Keurig is a champ) Overall, in my view, the positives far outweigh the negatives and I'm very happy with my purchase.",Great coffee and unbeatable convenience (as long as you are happy with the cost and variety of available pods),Amazon,19

2988,Breville,"April 24, 2018","Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville, Red",B01MR8XXLP,4," My wife and I love our nespresso. We’ve had various pod coffee makers and have always been disappointed. This is the first pod coffee that we actually like. Sure, it took us a little while to find flavors we liked (there are definitely some not so great ones) but now we are hooked. Bonus that it makes espresso too! I highly recommend the milk frother as well. Make some espresso, add the frothed milk and maybe some sweetener and you have yourself a drink any cafe could sell. Took me a little while to get used to the crema that forms on top the coffee but I have come to love it, so rich and tasty. And when it comes to the temperature of the coffee, I think it’s spot on. It just comes down to personal preference. I’ve never understood why most coffee makers produce scolding coffee that isn’t drinkable for 10 minutes. This is sippable right away, which is perfect when in a hurry. Pros: -fast and easy to use -send the aluminum pods back to nespresso for free to be recycled and composted -many flavors Cons -can only buy coffee online -not the cheapest coffee, however the only pod coffee I’ve found that is good -runs a little loud and can vibrate a large mug off base. -base does not accommodate larger mug (see picture) Ultimately I would highly recommend. Just understand this is not a traditional coffee maker, and it produces a coffee with rich/strong crema on the top!","Not traditional coffee, so much better!",Amazon,7

If you're into espresso drinks, the Nespresso is a good product. This model does not come with a milk frother, but it produces rich espresso in less time than it takes for a Keurig to warm up. Some things to be aware of: If you drink straight espresso, the temperature will not be very hot, largely because you're producing a small quantity of liquid, so it will cool off quickly in a cold cup. If you like cappuccino, latte, or Americano style drinks, you'll need hot milk or water anyway in a volume that is much greater than the espresso, so you'll have your hot drink. I usually zap the water or milk in the microwave and make the espresso on top. The cartridges cost more than for the Keurig but, again, you're not making coffee. Also, you can recycle the cartridges (get recycling bags from Nespresso).",Good espresso drink machine for the price,Amazon,14

Even in the descriptions they say it has notes of 'cereal.' What? I want Cherrios with my coffee, not in my coffee.

No weird noises, rattles, it's sturdy and relatively quiet. Initially, we had some difficulty getting the first cup out. I can't remember why, something about the first cleaning cycle, and not having the lock all the way tightened when making the first cup. It does take some effort to lock, and for 80+year old seniors, this is slightly a challenge. The coffee is consistent, but very bold. I have tried about 8-10 flavors at this point and do enjoy them all, but some are more tasty than others. The good coffee smell permeates the area quickly. I don't like that some information is not easily available about the coffee types. You've got to go to Nespresso's site and there's little information about the beans. There's definitely very little printed on the boxes when you order a 10 pack for example. Be prepared to spend money to drink coffee. At $1.10 a pod, this is much more expensive than buying a high quality bean and grinding a small amount daily. But, you do get massive convenience and the ability to make both espresso and coffee. If you drink mostly iced lattes daily for example, this might be a cheaper option than SB/CB/Peet's/etc (or the espresso only model) so go buy syrup and a milk product. When you lift the lid, the old cap goes into the trash bin on the right. Left side is for water. How long does the tank last?

Bought the first when they came out and the second so my wife could enjoy her favorite coffee at work. We bought the VentuoLine so I could enjoy Coffee while she could enjoy Expresso from the same machine and clear up some counter space by not having two different coffee/expresso makers in the kitchen. Unfortunately Nespresso's VentuoLine can not make expresso or real coffee. Why: Coffee needs to be brewed at a minimum temperature of 180F. Using two different thermometers the discharge stream gave a 160F reading. National Coffee Association recommends 195°F to 205°F so VentuoLine is 35°F below that recommendation, producing a bitter result. Expresso needs pressure to be called Expresso. That pressure is expressed by 'Bars'. 9 Bars is recommended to produce Expresso. VentuoLine produces between one to three bars maximum of pressure. Their effort to create pressure is by centrifugal force or spinning not compression. Unfortunately, 90% of the spinning is too slow to create anything close to 9 Bars of pressure. Spin velocity does increase dramatically at the end of the 'brew' but it only archives ridding the chamber and capsule of waist. The design of the chamber creates foam not Crema. You can create the foam by just adding water to a cutout empty capsule shell. This doesn't happen with the Citiz machine. Nespresso clearly invested a great deal into this machine and has hired the most endearing movie star to help sales. Unfortunately the VentuoLine in it's current design will never make acceptable coffee or anything close to being called Expresso.

I had an arm injury at work and can't apply a lot of pressure to turn or twist things. I thought if I used it a few times it would get easier but not the case. The decaf Intenso coffee was good but others tasted a bit watered down on the factory settings. I would've tried to set lower levels for the water had I kept it - perhaps that would've made a difference. The Melozio was fairly smooth and tasty but for my taste, the others just weren't up to the old style Nespresso machines. The froth was nice; like a giant layer of crema - and it did last thru the entire cup. If your taste buds aren't used to the stronger original Nespresso, this is definitely worth a try. If I could've found a safe way to open the machine without injuring my arm further, I may have ordered more of the Melozio and the decaf Intenso but I don't want to fight my coffee maker every time I want a cup. The machine sounds like a small jet taking off toward the end of the process and it may be necessary to have the lid lock tightly but it just was too tough for my arm to open.

If you read reviews on other sites you will find MANY people who have had the same experience with this machine that I have.  Don't be suckered in by the cute layer of froth on top of the beverage.  The coffee is brewed at a temperature that is less than lukewarm.  If you want it warmer then just stick it in the microwave but that cooks the froth and ruins it and the flavor of the coffee.  I tried most if not all of the coffee available and it all manages to come out tasting like some sort of instant coffee.  That's another thing.

3151,Breville,"April 1, 2016","Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville, Red",B01MR8XXLP,5,"We are VERY HAPPY with this coffee maker. First of all, let me explain how I decided to buy this machine. I asked a friend who is in the restaurant business, and who had recently done a vendor tour of Italy, what he thought of the Nespresso machines. He told me that Italy is mad about espresso, that you can get an excellent espresso anywhere in Italy, that even gas station attendants will pull you the perfect shot ofespresso. But when he asked his Italian friends what they drink at home, they say, 'Nespresso.' That cinched the deal for me. I ordered this machine the same day, and have not for one minute regretted our decision. My husband the coffee drinker has gone from drinking one cup of coffee a day to two, and I, the tea drinker, has been persuaded to start drinking coffee, because it is so easy to brew a cup, and it is so good! PROS This machine brews both coffee and espresso. This is important because older models only did long or short shots of espresso, and if you wanted a cup of coffee you were out of luck. The Nespresso brand of coffee capsules are very high quality and the taste is very good. Capsules are easy to buy online through the Nespresso website. Skip the third party vendors, just go straight to Nespresso. Capsules can be RECYCLED. This is huge for me because K-cups are killing our planet. You can bring them back to a vendor like a kitchen store like Sur La Table or Williams Sonoma, or mail it in. Machine is slim and does not take too much space. Easy to use, brews a cup of coffee in seconds with perfect crema on top. CONS Capsules have to be purchased online (with shipping charge) and there are very few retail stores that carry capsules. Capsules are bulky (esp the coffee ones) and take up a lot of space. There is just no good way of storing the things. Capsules are expensive. This is not a good machine for someone who drinks a pot of coffee a day, but perfect for someone who only wants one or two cups. The water container on the side is tricky to take out to refill, especially if you have your machine pushed up against a cabinet wall. It is also hard to tell if the container is empty as there is no indicator, and the ridges on the container make it hard to tell how much water is inside. You only know its empty when you try to make a cup of coffee and the machine makes a funny noise but doesn't work. But here's the problem. If at that point you stop and add water, you can't just turn it on again. It makes you put in a new capsule ($$$). The top where you put the capsule in is hard to lock. It takes force to close and lock it. A few times I didn't push it hard enough and didn't lock it completely, and the top bounced open, releasing the already punctured but not used capsule, which then is tossed by the machine into the trash compartment. You can't reuse it, at least I haven't figured out how, I tried and somehow it didn't work. So when you lock the top, you have to do it with conviction. One very important note: You don't need to buy the Nespresso brand frother! The steam of the coffee coming out slightly froths the milk already, and frothing it further is overkill. When we make coffee, we put a little milk in a mug, and zap it in the microwave for 30 seconds. Then we brew coffee in the espresso, and the steam coming out with the coffee froths up the already warm milk. (Heating up the milk beforehand also solves the problem that people have noted that their coffee was too cold. I've never found the coffee to be cold but I can imagine some like super hot coffee.) A few times my husband frothed the milk with a frother and when the coffee went into the cup, it made everything TOO foamy. The only exception would be if you wanted to make fancy espresso drinks, in which case you can buy a cheap frother for $15. I have the Aerolatte frother and it is small and handy and works great, and is MUCH cheaper than the Nespresso one. All in all, a great machine, and we are glad we bought it.",Perfect coffee maker,Amazon,13

The regular coffee even has a crema foam on top, so you get that espresso sweetness right on top.  The machine automatically dumps the used pod into a holder when you open it to make a new cup.  Very convenient. What I don't like:  I really, really, really wish it made the coffee hotter.  I know this is a trend in fine coffee brewing.

The coffee is good.  Quite good.  Far better than the average coffee shop.  Far far better than the average K-cup.  Not as good as the very best espresso I've ever had to be sure, but for simple morning coffee I am well pleased.  The machine is designed well and easy to use. In my opinion their traditional machines are sexier looking.  Vertuoline looks like it was made to compete with Keurigs.  You do have to push the head down pretty firmly while locking it so folks with strength issues may not like it.  The pods are expensive.  No doubt about it.  We have used $65 worth in a month for two people and a couple days of house guests.  You order them via the Nespresso app or website and they show up literally two days later.  Very convenient.  There are a few stores in very large cities where you can buy pods, but I can't even buy pods at the store where I purchased my machine!  They sent me off with two starter packs and a wave. Over the month, I have gradually found myself reaching for the smaller espresso pods instead of the larger coffee pods.  They have a much richer flavor and make a superior latte.  For this reason, I wish I had gotten the Citiz machine.  There is a much wider selection of coffees in the original line.  Oh well, Mr Fuji still uses the big pods for his cuppa.",Kind of wish I had gotten the Citiz,Amazon,6

My wife bought it for me for father's day even after I told her I didn't want one.  But I had a keurig that was getting old and had no way to clean the inside so I kept it to try out.  I drink a lot of coffee all day long but prefer it from a regular coffee pot machine.  The keurig at least tasted decent and the cups can be bought cheaply enough.  So now I have this machine that makes a nasty cup of warm acidic foam with a little coffee in the bottom and costs about 1 dollar each.  Oh, I guess I should add that I'm writing this review from bed due to the headache and vomiting and nausea that resulted from drinking three cups of this foul mix today.  I have never had this much caffeine in coffee.  I can't imagine what it would do to someone who doesn't drink coffee regularly.  This is the second time of used the machine and the second time I've had a caffeine overdose.  Last time I only had one cup so it wasn't as bad and I had thought it was from drinking too much coffee at work.  I had thought the foam would only come with some types of coffee as its supposedly brews differently depending on what type of pod you use.  But it's always there and I'm gagging just thinking of it, in fact I may go vomit some more.  To be fair I'm not sure if the vomiting is from the insane amount of caffeine or the acidity. I hate this machine and will never use it again.  I wish my keurig was still in my garbage can as I would rather use it even after being in a trash can all week.  And I still have some of these overpriced crap pods left.  I would hate it even more once I ran out and was unable to get the pods at the grocery store but that won't be happening. My wife claims she likes the coffee it makes but she can't drink more then 1 cup or she feels sick.  I can get a better cup of coffee at 7-11 and it may be cheaper.",It's garbage,Amazon,2

It is very simple to use, and it is capable of making both coffee and espresso. I also like the fact that it is made in Switzerland instead of China like most products you see these days. I have seen some complaints about the temperature of the coffee or espresso. I had the same problem, but I have found a solution for it: when you first turn on your VertuoLine, give it a few minutes before brewing your coffee or espresso.

The coffee was no better than a freshly ground and brewed cup of decent coffee you can find at a local coffee shop. The only benefit is the convienience over brewing the coffee.

I read through the instructions and thought maybe I needed to do the water-cleaning cycle, which I did. It didn't help; still blinked, and got a few drops when I brewed espresso. (For some reason, it continued to brew the full cups just fine. Alas, I had grown fond of the Americanos that it produced.) I read the instructions further and thought maybe I needed to descale it. I ordered the descaling kit directly from Nespresso and followed the instructions. My first cup of coffee tasted just like the descaling solution, which is to say, like reflux in your mouth. I then ran the water-cleaning cycle several times, and still have coffee that tastes like the foul descaling solution. I called Nespresso today and the person I spoke to gave me a few other cleaning tips involving a paperclip, but it STILL tastes and smells like the descaler. YUCK. It's not palatable. She says some people are just more sensitive to the solution, and next time I can use half of the solution packet. Trust me, there won't BE a next time. My only option at this point is to send it back (if approved) and get a refurbished unit in return. Then what happens when I have to descale it again? I'm extremely disappointed, to put it mildly. I'm not upset about the cost yet; I'm still mourning the loss of really good, really simple coffee in seconds.

The espresso is very light (not strong, light mouthfeel) and notes are not complex. Honestly, the number one issue we have with this machine are the capsules are so hard to get. We don't live near one of the very few Nespresso boutiques nor a Sur La Table, which means we are limited to purchasing from Amazon or Nespresso.com. The capsules are WAY overpriced on Amazon, and Nespresso makes you order in increments of 50. They only offer free two day shipping if you order 150 at a time or more. This machine uses bar codes on the capsules so I'd be very surprised if third-party retails create their own capsules. The original lines does have other companies creating capsules.

Not quite up to other standards, but ok with a coffee maker attached. Also too much of this foam they call creama.

Each new coffee maker has been better than the one before and that trend remains true with the VertuoLine. One reason I hesitated to purchase a Nespresso before is because I need a machine that does both coffee and espresso. I waited and watched and bought this right away! I love lattes but my husband likes coffee and we have guests who enjoy both. One thing I have noticed is that I barely ever make a latte anymore because the layer of crema on the coffee is so thick I feel like I am having a latte but get to have he much richer taste of a deep coffee - it's delicious!  I purchased the coffee package that gives you a box of every coffee and espresso they make so now have had many, many cups of each kind. I cannot decide which will be my regular - most have tasted fantastic to me!  The exception there is the flavors, vanilla and hazelnut both are a little to bitter.  Areas that need improving:  the coffee is most definitely NOT hot enough. I read that in several reviews and it is very true. I heat any milk or creamer if I am using it in the frother because if you add chilled cream (and I don't add a ton) the entire cup of coffee chills down too much leaving you to heat it in the microwave. Boo. I have always heated my coffee mugs before making coffee so that plus heating the creamer takes care of the issue sufficiently for me but is just another step. If the coffee didn't taste leaps and bounds better than the rest this might have made me return it. My other little issues are that is does not allow all of my travel mugs to fit under the spout. I have a couple tall skinny 16 oz. Starbucks mugs that I have to tilt and hold while the coffee is brewing.  I also have a few favorite mugs that are wide and very round.  The kind you can wrap 2 hands around as you sip. These come very close to not getting directly under the spout  because the diameter and round shape do not let them fall flush to the coffee maker under the spout. Thus I end up doing more babysitting of mugs while it brews than I would like.  Features I wish it had that the other machines did: the ability to make hot water for tea, the ability to add additional water to your coffee after it brews. I also wish the receptacle for empty pods was located behind the machine so it wasn't so wide. Reading this back it seems like I find more wrong with this than would warrant a 4 star rating but the fact is that the coffee tastes SO great that trumps all the little things I find wrong.  As an add-on comment, the stand they sell for holding pods is convenient but definitely not something you would display on the counter. Once you remove the pods you are looking at an emptying cardboard sleeve and it just looks bad.  Not worth more than $5 in my opinion.",Very close to perfect... But needs a few tweaks,Amazon,5

For some reason, Nespresso decided they needed to reinvent the wheel with the VertuoLine. Clever engineering for sure, but when it comes to making quality espresso and coffee, it fails miserably. For starters, the temperature of the coffee / espresso is way too cool, less than 145°F in a warmed cup. This is about 20°F cooler than the original Nespresso machines (my measurements, using a high quality digital thermometer). A quality espresso / coffee machine produces water between 195°F and 205°F at the brew head, which should result in a cup temperature around 165 - 175°F. Colder water tends to produce coffee that is acidic and a higher temperature results in a brew that is bitter, or burnt tasting. This flaw becomes immediately evident when tasting espresso from the VertuoLine, it is noticeably more acidic than a similar variety espresso prepared in a more traditional manner. Some varieties are better than others, but they all have an acidic note. This may also have something to do with the VertuoLine's unique method of extraction, using centrifugal force, rather than a high-pressure pump. The second problem I have with the VertuoLine is in the way it produces its so-called crema. In a conventional espresso machine, the high-pressure pump, forcing properly heated water, through properly tamped grounds, produces a rich, smooth crema. The VertuoLine instead, relies on a centrifuge, to force tepid water through the ground coffee, producing a type of foam, which only vaguely resembles crema. To make matters worse, it puts the same foam on top of coffee, producing a very strange cup. Coffee does not / should not have foam or crema on top. On the other hand, what the VertuoLine produces isn't really coffee, but more of a caffè crema, which may have a tiny bit of crema, but certainly not the thick layer of foam that the VertuoLine produces! The bottom line, in my opinion, the VertuoLine is more about marketing than quality coffee. I think it is evident that Nestlé is attempting to shore up their profits in the single serve coffee market, as their original patents expire. Their new, high tech pods may be difficult, or even illegal to copy, but they produce a sub-standard brew. The original Nespresso machines may no longer be innovative, but they produced superior espresso. In addition, because Nestlé's patents have run out, there are now several companies producing quality Nespresso compatible pods (original style), at greatly reduced prices. If you want great single serve espresso, at a bargain price, check out the new Nespresso Inissia, at right around $100.  For a bit more money, the original Nespresso machines, such as the Pixie or the Citiz have slightly better build quality and a larger water reservoir.  For single serve coffee, Keurig machines are popular, although none of them makes coffee as good as a quality drip machine. If you are into high tech, check out the Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT, there is none better! Technivorm Moccamaster Thermo Coffeemaker Pros: Can make both 'coffee' and espresso in one machine Simple automatic operation Easy cleanup Cutting edge - looks cool Cons: Both coffee and espresso come out way too cool Espresso is acidic Crema is not a true crema, but more like whipped foam Coffee tastes more like caffè crema, because that's really what it is!

To me the coffee from this machine has more flavor than my Keurig, however I'm keeping my Keurig for the host of other beverages you can make using K-cups.  The foam on top of the coffee from this machine starts out really great, like espresso, but eventually starts to look more like bubbles from dish soap.  That said, I don't really drink coffee for the looks, I drink it for the taste, and the regular coffee (not espresso) that I get for this machine tastes great to me.  The crema on the espresso from this machine does not hold up as well for me as the crema from the Citz, so I don't use this machine for espresso.  I like to use an insulated travel mug to drink my coffee so it stays hot (even more important with this machine as the coffee is not nearly as hot as from a Keurig) and the machine isn't tall enough to accommodate my travel cup.  So, I found a way to make it work that I wanted to share in case someone else has this same problem.  I purchased rubber feet (1.5' Sorbothane Hemisphere Rubber Bumper Non-Skid Feet) for the bottom of the machine to raise it up 3/4' and I remove the dip pan from the machine when using my travel mug.  There are many different heights of rubber bumper feet, so you would want to measure how much clearance you would need for your particular cup before purchasing them.  I also purchased the 'NIFTY 6145 Nespresso Vertuoline Capsule Drawer' which works really well.  I'll upload photos to show you how it works.  The first photo shows the rubber feet raising it up, the second photo shows the cup extending down below the brewer, the third shows the capsule drawer, and the fourth shows the machine pushed back against the counter.  With both the rubber feet and the drawer, I am not able to fully open the top of the machine to insert and eject capsules because of the cabinet above the machine.  However, the drawer glides on the counter so smoothly it's as if it has wheels on it, so it's easy to pull the machine/drawer unit forward, brew coffee, then push it back against the wall again.

I use it twice daily for a little espresso fix. A friend recently purchased the Vertuoline for me for a housewarming gift.  It was an awesome and thoughtful gift.  I ordered capsules from nespresso which came in 2 days.  I was so excited because I tried it out in the store.  The espresso was excellent for this instant home machine.  very thick crema, great flavor etc.  I got the machine out and followed the instructions for the first use.  You need to fill the tank with warm water and press the top button 3 times in less than 2 seconds to start the self cleaning process.  I tried this, but it wouldn't draw water from the tank.  The pump sounds like it is broken. There is an abnormal cracking sound in the machine.  I spent next 10 minutes working with a level 1 support person.  They concluded I needed a 'machine specialist' based on the codes that were blinking on the power button.  They said none was available immediately, but they would call me.  I waited about 2 hours, no call back, so I tried them again.  They said I need to wait up to 24-48 hours for a machine specialist.  Very, very odd.  They would not give a more narrow window. So, I get a call the next morning during work to 'troubleshoot' the machine.  It seems odd that nespresso support believes it's reasonable to randomly call within a 48 hour support window.  The support rep was very nice and tried to help, but there is little I can do without the machine since I don't randomly bring my machine to work in hopes that nespresso support might call me.  So, I opted for a return.  Despite saying they would send return labels, they never did.  So, I guess I'm out $25 to return machine and unopened/unused capsules.  I called my friend to let her know she should be on the look out for a credit from nespresso. She conveyed that the first one she bought was also defective and she had to exchange it. So in summary - 1.  Quality of machine and espresso when working - 4 stars 2.  Quality of machine/reliability - 1 star 3.  Quality of support - 2 stars (really should have call backs in less than 2-3 hours, or a least specify a time window in which you might call back). 4.  Quality of customer service/returns - 1 star (really should provide return shipping for a defective product) 5.  Quality of Nestle's Nespresso division (used to be 5 star, but after this experience, more like 2 star) I am disappointed that Nespresso puts out a consumer product like this.  I can understand that there will be rare malfunctioning units out of the box, but this seems inappropriate (2 of 3 were defective).  Their support is not consistent with high standards I've come to rely on from Nestle.  All in all, it left a bad taste in my mouth.",It was an awesome and thoughtful gift,Amazon,8

The issue with Expresso is that you are very limited in cartridge selection compared to their standard Expresso makers. For example, I drink decaf and there's only one choice with this machine, but with the other Nespresso machines there's 4 choices and they taste much better than the one available on the Vertuoline. One issue people complain about is the cup is not hot but I think it's because they don't wait for the brew light to go steady and is still warming up.

After doing a series of tasting tests between myself and several members of my family, the general verdict all around was that you might just as well use a classic Nespresso capsule in a classic machine and just press the large cup button twice to get a 'big cup' that tasted quite similar to a Vertuoline large capsule cup. The Vertuoline cup has significantly more caffeine, but the taste of watered down classic espresso is otherwise quite similar to Vertuoline large capsule. Vertuoline large capsules cost more than classic Nespresso capsules, so just using more water on a small capsule is more cost efficient. I also note that my order of Vertuoline capsules from Nespresso was delayed by a week or so because I had mixed the two capsule types on the same order. Nespresso apparently thinks that no sane customer would own both types of machine and hence they held back the order. But rather than call me to inquire, they just let the order sit in limbo until I called them and confirmed that I actually own both types of machine. The Vertuoline machine has now been in my house for a few months. Every visitor wants to use it, because it is 'shiny'. Nobody ever goes back to get a second cup of coffee from it - invariably, people switch to the classic machine for their second cup.

The coffee was unbelievably delicious.  The crema sold me.  However, like another reviewer stated, somehow at home the coffee seems somewhat more bitter than the sample at the store.  You can program the machine to add more water and it will remember this setting for future brews. I noticed the rep made fairly large cups so I am wondering if she had programmed the machine this way. I spoke with a Nespresso rep and she stated this was possible.  I added some more water to the the second strongest capsule blend and it was noticeably smoother so I will probably continue to do that.  Note, however, that while you can program the machine to add more water, and while it will remember your setting for future uses, it will only remember the setting to discern whether you are using a coffee or espresso capsule, not for a particular variety of coffee.  So, if you like a more intense capsule with additional water and a less intense variety with no added water, you will have to reset the machine each time and remember how long you pressed the button for your desired amount of water - kind of a pain (reason for the 4 star rating).  That being said, I love how it looks on my counter ( Tomato Red) and the coffee is so much better than my usual drip.

Eventually someone will come out with the iPhone of coffee/espresso brewers and we'll all rejoice! The big problem, as others have noted here (I owe you all apologies for not believing you), is that the coffee doesn't get hot enough.  When it first comes out, it's about as hot as you'd expect your coffee to be after sitting in a mug for 10-15 minutes.  I've brewed 6-8 cups so far and have never finished and entire cup, as it just gets downright cold...and I'm not a particularly slow drinker. I have a Kurig machine, and the coffee comes out at a great temperature. The Nespresso does seem to brew a little more quickly than the Kurig, but it's not a worthwhile trade-off for lukewarm coffee.  The foam layer on top of the coffee is just weird...it doesn't add anything, but I guess it's cool if you're into foam mustaches or something. The other issue for me is that it looks much nicer in the photos than it does in real life. I ordered the 'chrome' version and it just looks very plastic. The machine has a feature that 'automatically' removes the used pods, but they get dumped into the translucent side chamber and so you've got visible trash piling up in the side of the machine.

The coffee is okay too, better than Keurig, but less selection and more pricey. The downfall? too much foam. The foam is supposed to be a selling point, they call it 'crema', which I really don't think it is. It's more like foam. A true espresso has crema, which is due to a combination of the freshness of the beans, the heat of the water, and the pressure that the machine pushes the water through the said beans. It's a combo of the oils and gasses released from the beans...True espresso has 'crema'. A cup of coffee should not, by nature of the way it is brewed.

3243,Breville,"April 10, 2014","Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville, Red",B01MR8XXLP,5,"Firstly; my wife and I are huge coffee lovers. We spend a few hundred a month on Starbucks, CB&TL and Peets (sadly). We've used keurigs, the Vue and other home pod systems. We were looking for a coffe maker that 1) makes good expresso/latte 2) makes good coffee 3) doesn't require massive clean up and 4) doesn't cost $1200. This one beats all I've tried and meets all the criteria. I'd held off the Nespresso because you have to order the pods and it didn't make regular cups of coffee. Both issues solved. Firstly local boutiques sell the pods and you can order them through the Nespresso app & Amazon with a 2 day delivery. The Virtuoline makes regular coffee. Sweet! About the machines; The Virtuoline is completely reengineered. It takes a bar coded pod (which the machine reads), spins the pod at high speed equivalent to injecting over 19 bars of pressure. The result is a very creamy (Crema) coffee or expresso before you even add creamer/milk. Works exactly as they advertise. The Aerrocino plus is my new favorite toy. Somehow it froths milk into either a creamy blend or whipped froth (depending on which whip you use). My wife loves a foamy cappuccino and I like creamy latte's. It delivers every time. Coolest thing, one touch button and go. Simple and consistent. If you want to control the temperature, hear the steaming sound etc and then have to clean the nozzle everytime; you'll want a full expresso machine (ie pay 3 times as much and do 3 times as much work). Pros; * easy to use. Everything is literally 1 touch button. * Easy to clean. Auto eject pod, rinse milk frother. Done. * great performance: cream/milk frother; perfect! * Excellent expresso; vacuum sealed perfectly roasted coffee beans ground and pressurized. * Impressive Crema both coffee and expresso * Well made, heavy duty components. * Good selection of expresso and coffee * Superior customer service * Cost vs other options. Cons; * regular coffee (not expresso) is a little watery (but flavorful) if you don't short the cup at about 6 ounces. * lack of ability to customize, options (if you really want to meddle) * ordering pods * separate milk frother. Summary; This is an absolute keeper. Meets all my needs, is affordable, doesn't require a massive cleanup every time you make an expresso and delivers consistent delicious coffee. Worth waiting for!

3244,Breville,"April 6, 2014","Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville, Red",B01MR8XXLP,5,"First, we've tried Keurig, Nespresso, and a super automatic espresso maker.  I really like the Virtuo.  The Keurig produces fairly weak and flat tasting coffee.  It's drinkable, but bland.  The super automatic doesn't produce a decent full size coffee unless you want an Americano. And, the espresso is still pretty mediocre.  The new Virtuo produces a very nice tasting espresso AND a very nice strong cup of coffee.  None of these options produces an espresso that compete with a professionally produced shot from a real high-end machine.  But, the Virtuo tastes really good and produces the best quality product of any of these home options. The downside is that there is still only a small selection of pods.  Hopefully, there will be more soon.  However, the ones that ARE available are quite good.  For instance, the Stormio blend produces a very strong cup of coffee that doesn't have off flavors.  Good aroma and good flavor. I prefer, the 2nd darkest coffee, Altissio.  They also produce a nice half caff coffee capsule and a decaf.  Currently only one decaf option for espresso.  In my opinion the espresso produced with this machine is superior to the original Nespresso. No, the crema isn't 'real crema' as a few people have pointed out, but it serves the same purpose and you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference...except the Virtuo produces far more of it than in a bistro produced espresso.  I like it. Yes, could be hotter, but it is sufficient for me. The real question for this machine will be durability.  It's technically a more complex machine than the original Nespresso since it incorporates a centrifuge. However, we've had horrible luck with durability of saeco super espresso machines which are more expensive (up front) than the Virtuo and still produces a mediocre pour.  Of course, you'll pay more for pods overtime.  BTW, buy the pods from Nespresso..the ones listed on Amazon are significantly over-priced.

3245,Breville,"April 4, 2014","Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville, Red",B01MR8XXLP,4,"We love the coffee blends that Nespresso produces, and we have been major fans of the Nespresso espresso machines for many years.  So I had to try this new machine.  It is geared towards households that include both espresso aficionados and those who like a well-brewed cup or mug of coffee. This machine produces a wonderful, flavorful brew--just like the rest of the Nespresso line.  My issue--and I think it is a major one--is that the pods are different from those used in other Nespresso machines; they are larger, more cumbersome and take up a LOT more storage area, there are not as many blends/flavors from which to choose (compared to the pods available for the espresso machines), and they are significantly more expensive. If this will be your first Nespresso machine, you won't have any preconceived notions about size, number of blends, and price of the pods.  And if you are looking for a machine that gives you a complete range of coffee pours, this is a machine to consider.  If this will be your first quality (not talking average Keurig or Tassimo, here) single-pour machine, you cannot go wrong with a Nespresso machine.  If you want the convenience of coffee pods, Nespresso is simply the best choice.  (If you want single-serve, without pods--and if your budget will allow it--consider one of the Jura ENA machines.) If your family drinks more mugs of coffee than espresso shots, the price of the Vertuo discs will have a lot more value for you:  They are definitely less expensive than using two Lungo (long cup) pods in one of the Nespresso espresso machines. But, if you are thinking about switching from an older Nespresso espresso machine to this one, you will have to trade out the small capsules for the much larger discs specifically suited for the Vertuo.  And if you are thinking that you will keep your old Nespresso machine for espresso shots, plus get this one for the coffee mugger in your house, you will need to have a supply of both disc sizes.

Blah, that's all I have to say in general.  Let's touch on the 'crema' first.  Usually crema is an emulsion produced by emulsifying the oils/soluble solids in the coffee grounds as hot water is FORCED through the coffer under a specified pressure.  Done correctly this delivers a nice thick (but never bubbly or foamy) crema atop the shot or coffee.  So, this new machine dumps the pressure brewing thing and pours water in the capsule, whisks it around using their Centrifusion technology, and then pours a coffee or espresso with a excessively-thick 'crema' on top of whatever you just made.  Even the best barista around would be hard-pressed to produce a crema/coffee ratio like this.  Why is this a bad thing?  Crema, like the 'moment' that is a truly great espresso, is 'fleeting'; and there is NOTHING fleeting about the vertuoline crema.  I have a test for you to explain.  Make a coffee on your new machine.  Take the cup with you, get in the car, drive to your local coffee shop and then order a fresh pressed shot of coffee.  Sit at the table, drink the decent coffee and look at the crema on your Nespresso coffee...  Is it still there?  I am sure it is, it will probably never go away.  Its an overly-whipped, super-constructed crema with no heart.  I believe nespresso is playing to America's misunderstanding of what crema should be and the kind of 'ohhh look at that crema' people who will be buying these things. That being said, the coffee under that machination of nespresso called crema is not terrible.  Which in the end asks the question: why buy this new whipping machine when the original already makes a good espresso?  Well I suppose they want you to buy their new machine to help them try and grab some of that market share out from under Keurig.  So before you fall for the newest marketing ploys of the big boys in coffee; just make sure that you actually like what is coming out of the spout.  If you do, then that is all that matters.  Espresso is a passion and a hobby for me, so I have a different take on it, so does the every-dayer that gets up and pops in a capsule to get a boost of a certain drug... which category do you fall under??? Oh... p.s. the Aeroccino is fine, the foam will be a very dry foam (if you are used to hand-pulled microfoam), and it heats the milk too hot for me.  My max is 145-155 at most!  This goes to at least 170 and sometimes higher for random reasons.  This borders on scalded milk and can sometimes bring out that scalded milk flavour.  Sometimes this can introduce off tastes into the cappy or whatever you made, esp in lattes.",A definite downgrade... (from std Nespresso),Amazon,19

First a little about me: I own a Nespresso Pixie which I love and have had for several months.  I find it makes espresso, which to me tastes better than what I get at Starbucks and actually is of the quality I am used to in Spain or Miami.  Absolutely amazing.  Personally, the Dulsao is my favorite pod for it.  Combined with the latissima I also own, I make amazing vanilla, chocolate and caramel lattes that are better than anything I get at a coffee shop and much cheaper.  I should also note, I live within walking distance of a Nespresso store in a large U.S. city and get my pods directly from them for around $7 a carton, which they call 'sleeves.'  Being that I live in a major city, space for me is very limited in my kitchen, accordingly, when I saw a machine that combines both espresso making and drip coffee I thought I'd fallen in love...and to boot its the same amazing tasting espresso I am used to from my pixie.  The drip coffee is also quite good, but I am very partial to my Peets coffee and after a few days, I realized I could not live without it, so for me the machine had to go back.  However, Nespresso's drip is also quite good.  If you are not as attached to a specific drip brand as I am, then you may find one of Nespresso's drips works for you. Here are some of the potential down sides I found with the machine that led to my return, that you may also find: (1) This is a North America only product and has a new style pod and is not backward compatible: meaning for me, if I go back to Europe, while it is very easy to find Nespresso pods or Nespresso compatible pods in the supermarkets in Southern Europe, these pods will not be available there, I won't be able to use it like I do with the pixie as it does not accept the regular Nespresso pods. (2) The pods are quite large, significantly larger than the regular Nespresso pods, about 2 inches thick and 3 1/2 to 4 inches in diameter, so for my tiny apartment this was a bit of a factor. (3) I was a little nervous about the long term support of the product, after a neighbor of mine saw it and told me her experience with the Keurig Vue, where she is having problems finding pods after Keurig seems to be more focused and dedicated to its traditional gen1 pod which has a wider consumer base.  I decided this would be a reason to return and wait and see until it builds a bigger customer base, especially since this is basically a US/Canada only product, and Nespresso already had a huge customer base in Europe before it introduced its espresso makers here in the US with the pixie and u series and whatnot.","Great tasting, stylish but returned while waiting for a wider customer base to ensure long term pod support",Amazon,5

Of course this lead to listening to the pump for 3 minutes as it pumped all that water through for a full sized 7oz cup.  Nor did my coffee cup fit, and finally perhaps my biggest complaint is the water temp.  It was clearly espresso warm not coffee hot....and I do like hot coffee. But ohhhhh, the coffee...I mean seriously for a single serve machine the coffee can not get better.  I am shocked with people saying it wasn't good.  I think it is consistently great java.  Short of roasting, grinding, and pulling your own espresso this is as good as it gets.  It just is. So I was excited to get the mailer for the new Vertuoline machine! What is this nespresso's shot across the bow of keurig.  Finally, my coffee mug will fit.  Great coffee, great crema! I was in! I ordered direct from nespresso.  My new chrome vertuoline and welcome coffee kit arrived in... you guessed it two days. It was a simple unbox and plug in.  Now as you will have read there is a difference in these vs prior nespressos.  This works by pumping water through a pod that is basically spinning around using centrifugal force to I guess make great coffee with good crema. This being said on first inspection the pods are basically on steriods if you were used to the other pods.  They look kinda like flying saucers.  However, like previous there is a line of coffee pods based on strength and intensity, two flavored pods hazelnut and vanilla, decaf, half caf, and then a line of 4 or so espresso pods.  They have little barcodes that the machine reads that basically tells it if it is pooring a coffee or espresso shot. Fill left sided reservor with water, right side for ejected pods.  Basically put pod in, lock down the top, push button once.  Overall compared to my previous experience the process was simple and the coffee was poured alot faster than my previous long pump method.  The time to heat up was seconds compared to a keurig, but the poor time is perhaps a few seconds longer. My thoughts- Everything you know and love if you already love nespresso.  Excellent coffee and espresso in a much better looking package than keurig machines.  Hands down again amazing coffee. Seriously, if you don't know about the coffee please go try it.  I really could not see someone being disappointed.  There is a selection based on intense roast to mild.  Like anything palates vary so try the sampler. It is actually amazing how different some are.  If you have a nespresso and only drink espresso I would say this is not an upgrade and would keep your machine. However if you are looking for a coffee experience it was totally worth it. I really do love this machine. The nespresso and coffee experience is spot on. And if you want you can program how much water goes through should you want to vary this from the presets. Why the one star off....Well I will say that the coffee is warmer than my prior d290, but it is still cooler than the keurig.  I think the Keurig was about 167 degrees and I bet the nespresso is about 160-162.  I would kill to be able to turn up the heat just alittle....even if it wasn't the 'best' brew temp for the coffee.  I think this is in fact perhaps the Achilles heal for competing with keurig.  Most American drinkers, that drink a craft or drip brew are used to that extra hot coffee. So it may bug you to poor a nice coffee and then feel it is luke warm.  I do run hot water on my cup prior to having coffee, and it is close enough for me. But I wish I had the option to turn it up a few degrees. Second is perhaps the waste factor.  Before I felt wasteful throwing away my old capsules, now they seem twice the size.  Nespresso will recycle them if you live next to a nespresso store, which I would say basically no one does.  Heck I would even save them and ship them back...even pay extra to recycle them. Alas so not perfect, but I would be shocked if there would be much to complain about here.  Coffee is excellent, alittle too cool.  Perfect for a mug at home....maybe not perfect for your 32 oz too go cup.... Cheers! An updated thought on temperature: A keurig single pod machine often has an adjustable brew temp of 187-192 degrees.  Nespresso brews tops at about 170 degrees. (about 160s in most tests)  If you are used to having drip at DD or starbucks, or McDonalds or just out of a keurig 160s will seem barely 'hot' for a standard cup of coffee. That being said I think the coffee is wonderful, but I would love for a few extra degrees or at least a chance to adjust it for those that perhaps enjoy very hot coffee. A good example is if you went into starbucks and order a latte it will be served at 145-165 degrees.  If you order an 'extra hot' latte it will be closer to 180 degrees. 160 cools quickly so if (like me) you add some creamer from the fridge that brings it down to 140-150.  So your coffee cools pretty quickly.  I do wish nespresso would let those of us that perhaps like it alittle hotter to up the brew temp, much like the keurig.",New Tech from nespresso,Amazon,228

In other words, I'm picky. For regular everyday coffee, I actually lucked out in finding a great solution using a Black & Decker 12-cup maker, and a time-tested specialty grind of coffee. When looking for a great solution for espresso makers, not so much.  I don't normally like the coffee/espresso combo makers because one or other of the functions usually suffer.  I was skeptical that the Nespresso VertuoPlus was going to be any different.  I couldn't have been more wrong. I now use this machine exclusively as an espresso maker. I've found this coffee maker tends to make stronger coffee than other machines in its class, which is very important for me.  My biggest complaint with pod-based coffee machines is that the coffee doesn't reach the level of strength that I like personally.  If you like your coffee STRONG, you won't be disappointed with this.

Therefore, when I had the opportunity to try the NESPRESSO VERTUOPLUS DELUXE COFFEE AND EXPRESSO MACHINE BUNDLE WITH AEROCCINO MILK FROTHER, I decided to give it a try. Other than the commercials with Alec Bladwin, I had never heard of Nespresso before. Basically, Nespresso is a company that is attempting to compete with Keurig. In terms of taste, I have to say I enjoy the coffee made from my the NESPRESSO VERTUOPLUS DELUXE COFFEE AND EXPRESSO MACHINE BUNDLE WITH AEROCCINO MILK FROTHER machine much better than what I’ve tried from Keurig machines.

The machine works better at making expresso than coffee, but it still makes a good cup of coffee. With that said, although the NESPRESSO VERTUOPLUS DELUXE COFFEE AND EXPRESSO MACHINE BUNDLE WITH AEROCCINO MILK FROTHER makes a good cup of coffee and great “cups” of expresso, it does have some drawbacks. First of all, the power cord connected to the machine is not very long. You have to place the machine pretty close to a power outlet. That’s a small thing, but it’s something buyers should be aware.  Another drawback to the machine is that if you have a coffee cup that is larger than the standard size, it might not fit properly under the spout. However, the biggest drawback of the machine are the options in the Nespresso pods themselves. As I mentioned earlier, I think Nespresso tastes better than Keurig. Unfortunately, Keurig has been around much longer and has many more options. Overall, I enjoy the NESPRESSO VERTUOPLUS DELUXE COFFEE AND EXPRESSO MACHINE BUNDLE WITH AEROCCINO MILK FROTHER.  The milk frother is a great selling point. However, there aren’t very many Nespresso pods right now.

My husband thinks he is a barista now and forces foamy mugs of “art” as he calls it under my nose for me to gaze upon wheth I appreciate it or not. The inclusion of a Aeroccino 3 milk frother makes this a great value proposition as it has cut our trips to starbucks so my wallet is happier even thought the Vertuoline pods are about a dollar a piece (espresso just under a dollar and the regular coffee is just over a dollar) and results in a delicious cup of coffee\latte\cappuccino. The initial cleaning cycle takes about 1 minute to run and then you are up and running. The lever on the front operates a motor which lifts the top – the used pods eject into a section in the back which is removable and allows for easy clean up, some of the espresso pods need a little assist with this process from time to time. But Nespresso can send you a bag you put them in and then the company will recycle them for you so you look like a rockstar in front of your kids. The default settings allow for a delicious cup of coffee with the coffees weighing in at 7.4 oz and the espresso produces around 1.4oz. The unit works by reading the barcode on the nespresso capsule and spinning the capsule to produce a thick crema while brewing a delicious cup of coffee. Plus I get to see my great big hubby holding a teeny, tiny demitasse cup for his miniature espresso shot which is just hilarious.

The Breville is an attractive enough machine, not too big and and simple to use and clean. The coffee itself is delicious, but we have never been disappointed by Nespresso capsules. Some people cautioned that it was not hot enough, and while it does not seem to get as hot as our Le Cube, it’s pretty hot. The big problem is that the tank leaks 80% of the time. We have tried moving it, jiggling it, shifting it, and nothing seems to help. Sometimes I walk by and it’s dry, then 5 minutes later it’s leaking, and no one has touched it. I cannot figure it out, and it’s disappointing because I’ve come to expect better craftsmanship from Nespresso.

For those who prefer espresso over milk blended drinks, this machine is the better option in my opinion and I have upped my rating to four stars.* There is an extensive range of espresso machines with Nespresso branding and after a few weeks of putting the Breville version of the VertuoPlus through its paces, I can confidently aver, this is one of them… For several years I have coveted a friend’s high end espresso machines hoping serendipity or financial windfall would allow me to get my hands on one. Okay, a full complement of mortal sins might be a more accurate description of the depths of my desire since I may have used a 3D printer to build a few voodoo dolls in her image as I choked on the bitter vetch spewed out by my poor relation less expensive machines.  Thanks to the VertuoPlus, I may place at least one of the dolls not necessarily in retirement but quite conceivably in stasis. This is not a high end device (so long as you ignore the price of capsules which must have been based on a page straight out of the inkjet printer manufacturers' playbook) as far as acquisition price is concerned and it certainly has a few idiosyncrasies that will irritate a segment of potential purchasers – first and foremost in my opinion the absence of any way to control water temperature. I do not believe the machine has that large of a footprint and in our case actually requires less counter space than host of other coffeemakers we have shelved for posterity.  After completion of the initialization process, the machine is simple to operate.  It is a sleek looking unit with a multi-positional 60oz water reservoir, a motorized head initiated by a front positioned lever that also is employed in conjunction with the power button to initiate some specialized functions like programming water allocation preferences for individual coffee capsule types and descaling when prompted by an annoying series of halo lamp light flashes. It should be noted this model can accommodate 8 oz. Coffee and 1.35 oz. Espresso. The manual also mentions a 14oz size setting but I can’t find a way to implement it. Depleted capsules are ejected into a rear positioned basin. I find the Nespresso coffee choices to be above average and in no small measure a significant reason why the VirtuoPlus does produce a decent espresso or with utilization of the convenient, complementary and easy to use aeroccino, a pretty decent cappuccino or latte. However, you can make your own capsules (tedious but I don’t apologize for being cheap) with a quality supply of coffee beans, burr grinder,  My-Cap vPACK - Complete Solution to Make Your Own Capsules for Nespresso VertuoLine Brewers . and a recovered, bar-coded genuine Nespresso capsule aluminum base.",It's...okay.,Amazon,2

I thought this machine would be too complicated, it is amazingly simple to set up and use!  Delicious, hot coffee and it truly is the best home brewed coffee I have had.  I will continue to buy all varieties until I found the one I like the most for mornings. Takes up less counter space than my medium sized Keurig. The water tank is ingenious in that it can swivel to one side or the other of the brewer, giving you better options as far as counter space.  Depending on which side you want the water tank on, you can wind the cord under the brewer base to come out discreetly on that side to a nearby wall socket.  Simply set the water tank on top of the swiveled base and that's it!  Next, the cup holder is heavy weight and gorgeous honey comb that you can move up and down like a shelf in your refrigerator.  Ends any splashing if using a small cup, especially if you like espresso.  Machine automatically kicks back your empties in to a waiting slide out container in the back to be disposed of when you feel like it or it gets full. The coffees and expressos come in delightful foil pods, that you know are keeping the grounds fresh and moist and adds to this full brew aroma and flavor. The milk frother.

3297,Breville,"January 16, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"We've had this Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus for about a month now. So far, we love it. Some highlights: Clever design for the water reservoir. Water is taken up into the machine through the very bottom of the reservoir, passing through the base. The reservoir is easy to remove for filling — just lift. It never drips or spills out the bottom. You can easily see the water level, and it looks good on the counter. You can easily move the power cord and water reservoir to the left or right side of the machine. The power cord exits from the tongue of the reservoir base, and you can just rotate the base from one side of the machine to the other with a push. Again, great design — simple and user-friendly. Operation couldn't be easier. Gently lift once to open, insert capsule, gently push once to close. Press button on top. Enjoy. For me, the frothing accessory is the best part. It combines drop-dead simple operation with super-easy cleanup and whisper quiet operation. No steam pressure, no noise, virtually no cleaning (just a quick rinse when done.) No kidding. I know it sounds too good to be true, so judge for yourself: Step 1: Pour in milk and press the button. Max levels are marked on the inside, stamped in the metal so marking won't fade. A quick press gets you hot milk, a longer, 2-second press gets you cold frothed milk. An indicator lights up red for hot or blue for cold to visually confirm your choice. Step 2: Wait 60-70 seconds. Pour out your delicious, perfectly frothed milk. Step 3: Rinse the frother, and it's ready for the next use. The whisking attachment in the bottom of the machine is tiny, about 3cm or 1.5 inches in diameter. It's magnetically attached, no visible moving parts. It's set in motion through electromagnets, so it is virtually silent while operating. (It's similar to a fish tank filter impeller, if you've ever examined one of those in detail, except much, much quieter due to the superior materials and design.) It just spins around and does it's thing. If for some reason you need to remove the whisk for cleaning (say, if you didn't rinse it right after use, and need to soak it or more thoroughly wash), it's easy to remove. Again, it's magnetically attached: just pull up and out. No exposed parts, nothing to break, no way to get it wrong. It's by far the best frothing device or accessory I've every used, beating out my previous favorite methods by a wide country mile. Finally, the quality of the cup of coffee this can make: it's pretty darn good. The crema and texture are great. It doesn't quite come up to the standards of my favorite dedicated home espresso machine when I've got the grind, tamp, and pressure perfect. On the other hand, it's pretty close, and this machine is more versatile, produces a consistent result every time, and is about a thousand times more convenient to use. If I had one complaint, it would be that you have no control over the temperature of the finished cup. If you like your coffee extra-hot, you're out of luck. Personally, I find the coffee this machine produces to be at the right temperature, but I can see where others might to be able to make it hotter. Would recommend this model to anyone who loves coffee, and doesn't have the time or inclination to fuss with a high-end espresso machine every morning.","great coffee, clever design, amazing frothing accessory",Amazon,0

3303,Breville,"January 9, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"Crema is the delicious mocca-colored froth on top of a shot of espresso that is formed when air becomes trapped in coffee's aromatic oils. This crema is what separates premium espresso coffees from regular drip. This is why the coffee houses charge you so much more money for a cup of cappuccino than a diner does for coffee with milk. Nespresso machines produce an enormous amount of crema! Look at that stock photo; that's not an exaggeration. This comes with a generous variety pack so you can sample 1 of many varieties ranging from mild to bold, full-caff to decaf, and a decent sampling of espressos as well as full-cup coffees. Pods are a bit pricy, so this is your chance to figure out your preferences. Used the machine over a month now, without issues. Nearly flawless coffee every time. The only flaw is that the crema is foamier than premium shop espressos. The texture is less silky and rich, but every bit as tasty. And you won't hardly notice or care if you sip it in the first few minutes while it's piping hot. It's when it starts cooling and collapsing that you notice the foaminess. The Aerocinno accessory is impressively functional. Add milk, press button, get warm frothy milk in minutes. Again, a little foamier than steamed milk, but more of it! You'll want to use clear coffee glasses from now on so you can see the beautiful striations of your homemade cappuccino. About the price-tag; you'll hear this comparison often. Nespresso costs the same as a high-end Keurig, but K-cups are way cheaper! Yes, but K-cups produce great Donut/Diner coffee. Nespresso makes espressos. Not the same. To say they're both coffee is true, but calling cheese and butter both dairy doesn't make them interchangeable either. The better comparison is to hold Nespresso cappuccino against a Starbucks cappuccino. Arguably, I'd say the Nespresso is better and costs only a third as much as the store-bought. Seen that way, Nespresso is the better value. Bottom line: It's 95% as good as the best cappuccino I've ever tasted, and I can make it at home anytime quickly easily and pretty cheaply.",All about the crema.,Amazon,0

The machine is attractive and has a smaller footprint than my Kuerig and has a nifty feature that kicks out the used capsule into a disposal bin at the back. The capsules are quite cute - colorful and shiny. I can imagine collecting them for crafty projects such as Christmas ornaments. However the #1 plus about this machine is the fact that it makes incredible coffee - at least it does once the user figures out how to use the machine. The first several cups of coffee we tried to make did not want to stop and overflowed our large travel mug. We did finally watch a youtube video that showed us how to reset the machine and it has worked perfectly since. We obviously did something wrong at the beginning. The frother also works beautifully and retails for approximately $100 on its own. I will say that for our personal use, I plan to stick with my Keurig. The price of the Nespresso capsules for this machine is cost prohibitive. The correct capsules are also not readily available in local stores in our area. The fact that there are so many different models of the Nespresso machines makes it even more difficult to find the proper capsule for this machine. I know that I can always order them on Amazon but sometimes one just wants to pick up a box while shopping. I have also been unable to find a DIY kit to use my own coffee in this machine which is also a deal breaker for us.

My favorite so far has been the Nespresso Essenza Mini Espresso Machine, however this one is good too.  I also will compare this against the Nespresso Vertuo Evoluo Coffee and Espresso Machine by De'Longhi. First: I love the size of this machine.  It's not as compact as the Essenza Mini but it's close. The water tank swivels so you can adjust it depending on your space.  It's a LOT quieter than the Vertuo Evoluo by De'Longhi. Second: The difference really between the Essenza Mini and this one is the ability to brew different sizes of coffee.  The larger pods are used for a bigger cup of coffee, the smaller, flatter pods are espresso pods.  The Mini only brews espresso.  However, when it comes to cost for the pods, I would prefer the mini because the coffee is absolutely delicious and the pods are less expensive. The frother works amazingly well and is super easy.  Pour milk, push of the button, viola! Another drawback that I've found with this particular machine is the heat.  It doesn't brew as hot as the other two Nespresso machines I've mentioned.  I find myself having to microwave my cup of coffee to get it a litter warmer.  That is a real bummer. Overall, the machine is gorgeous, brews delicious coffee & takes up little counter space.

3306,Breville,"January 6, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"This is a very nice coffee machine set that contains: a Nespresso VertuoPlus coffee maker by Breville, a  Nespresso Aeroccino3 Milk Frother , and a sampler variety set of 12 Nespresso Vertuoline coffee pods for use with the coffee maker. Overall, the user experience with this machine is top-notch, simpler than with Apple products. From the moment you pick up the package, the heft suggests 'serious kitchen appliance'. The unboxing experience is well-designed, presenting all the product components. After you plug in the machine, put water in the reservoir, and put a cup on the platform, you can make a delicious coffee in exactly two minutes: (1) press any button to turn on the machine and start warming up; (2) press the lid button to open the motorized lid, which usually ejects the previous pod; (3) insert a new pod; (4) press the lid button to close the motorized lid; (5) press the top button to make the coffee. So simple. Ordinary maintenance consists of adding water to the reservoir, which can accommodate eight standard coffee-size cups; and emptying the used-pods bucket, which can hold the 8 coffee-size plus 4 espresso-size pods from the sampler set. The milk frother is very convenient and easy to use to make hot or cold frothy milk. Long-press or short-press and the blue or red light indicates hot or cold froth. Important considerations: * There are three sizes of Nespresso Vertuoline pods, each designed to make a particular size of coffee: Espresso (1 level tbsp of medium ground), Coffee (2 level tbsp of medium ground), Alto. Each pod has a bar code around the edge, which the machine reads to determine the type of coffee to make. The sampler set doesn't contain Alto pods. At the time of writing, Nespresso is the only provider of these pods, in packs of 10, and each Espresso pod costs USD$0.95; each Coffee pod costs USD$1.10; each Alto pod costs USD$1.20. Suppose you use this machine for a year and you make one coffee per day: your average cost is around $2 per cup. * The instructions say you can program your desired drink size. It is not clear whether the machine stores the preference for both pod size and flavor or per pod size only. Either way, this means that only one preference can be stored; so all users of the machine must have the same size of coffee for a given pod. (Instructions say this is not for office use.) * After each coffee drink is made, sometimes a few drops of coffee seem to be spilled on the inside of the machine, just forward of the pod holder. This is annoying but not hard to clean up. * I am trying out this machine through the Amazon Vine program, so I did not pay the $200+ for this set. I received this box at the beginning of December 2017, and the included sampler set had a best-by date of November 30, 2017. Every coffee from that set tasted bad, with bitterness and no flavor. The caffeine kick was comparable to Starbucks. At that time, I felt the hints to add milk were just to cover up bad coffee. Against this evidence, in early January 2018, I personally ordered a sleeve of  Nespresso VertuoLine Giornio Coffee, 10 Count  (medium roast) pods and received a pack with a best-by date of August 31, 2018, and this tasted much much better, with no bitterness at all. * If you are used to Keurig machines, you should know that this machine's lid is motorized, not manual, and it doesn't open/close without electricity.",A great gift for someone who like crema (foam) on coffee,Amazon,0

I absolutely love it, it has turned my morning coffee into a treat that kicks off my day beautifully. I didn't drink coffee every day before using this, but now I look forward to it when I get out of bed! I still like my old Keurig too, but it makes a much more utility cup of coffee. You can get some fairly tasty blends in all kinds of brands now, and with a flavored creamer, it gets the job done. Nothing wrong with a good old standard cup of coffee. The Nespresso Vertuo though, this is really special. The coffee itself is tasty, expertly blended, and I gotta admit I love the fancy way it comes out of the machine! If you have clear glass mugs, it is a delight for your eyes as well as your tongue (add milk or creamer first, then watch it make 3 distinct layers like a coffee parfait). The only sad part is that the pods are still very expensive. Nespresso still holds the patent, so you won't be seeing a lot of imitators for the Vertuo pods anytime soon. If you don't have a Nespresso Boutique nearby, you'll have to order direct or buy them from Amazon. They are cheaper per cup than going to a coffeehouse, so there's that, but more expensive than K-cups. One nice thing is that Nespresso will recycle the pods for you! The pods automatically drop into a bin behind the coffeemaker, and when full you can drop them into a recycling bag that you can return directly to Nespresso. If you don't have a Boutique nearby, you can request that they send one to you (and can send back to them when full). Will it save you money? Probably not, unless you're spending $10/day going to a local artisan coffee joint. If you want to treat yourself though, get one!

When they offered me a second, very similar one, I knew it would be perfect for my son. The following are his thoughts about the unit: My biggest concern with these pod machines is the amount of waste created. Luckily it seems that Nespresso is willing to help with this and provides a free of charge recycle bag for the used pods. With this Vertuo machine the bag would hold up to 100 used pods. Now to the machine! The machine comes with a variety pack of coffee and espresso to try. On the underside of each pod is a bar code that the machine scans. All the user has to do is put the pod in the machine, press the button and the appropriate amount of water is dispensed. You can then hold the button down to dispense more water if you would like your coffee lighter. The cup/drip tray height can be adjusted very easily depending on the size of cup you are using. When you are ready to insert a new pod you tap the open button and the used pod is ejected to the waste collection receptacle on the back of the machine. Then you are ready to go. A neat feature of the Vertuo Plus is the water tank. It can rotate along the back of the machine making it easy to place in many locations of a kitchen. It will be interesting to see how this part of the machine holds up over time. The coffee is very tasty! I have tried the darker ones and love them! The espresso is very good as well. So far I have two complaints: First, the power cord is very short! Another foot of length would have been nice. Secondly there is no storage space for new pods. It would have been nice to have a side rack on the machine to store some pods. Nespresso does sell pod holders so this isn't a deal breaker. Although this machine will not replace my drip coffee machine, it is a nice addition for a quick cup. It will also come in handy with guests who could have different taste preferences. I can't comment on the milk frother as I drink my coffee black. I will say it does look elegant and if you like milk in your coffee it will look nice on your counter.

Not as compact as the Pixie but still on the narrow side with only the water reservoir sticking out from the side.  Conveniently, the water reservoir can pivot from side to side or just stick out from the back. * Flexibility.  Unlike the original design the Vertuo machines makes regular coffee as well as large and small espressos. * Automatic water level selection.  With the Pixie, you had to manually choose whether you wanted to make a large or small cup of Espresso.  This machine reads a code on the pod and automatically chooses the water level for you. * Less drips.  this machine seems to drip less after the process completes than my Pixie does.  Maybe machine to machine specific but a nice side benefit. * Includes pod sample pack.  A small selection of the standard pods that are available to buy. * Aerocino milk frother included in the bundle.  Very handy accessory that works well to heat, froth, or do both to your milk.  Also, an expensive accessory to purchase separately if you decide you want one later. * You can request a pod recycling bag from Nespresso for free with any order. Just fill and mail back with prepaid shipping. Cons: * Pods are more expensive.  Even the espresso pods which should have the same amount of coffee are on average 10 cents more than Original line pods.  Full size coffee pods can cost upwards of $1.25 per cup. * Pods are mail order only (mostly).  Can't walk into the grocery store and pick up more pods.  I say 'mostly' mail order because there are a few Nepresso retail stores throughout the country but they are pretty much located in the largest trendiest areas. *  Larger option still not 'North American' large.  A large cup of coffee means making a standard 8oz cup of coffee.  To get something larger than that will require using multiple pods which will easily start to get you into Starbucks drip coffee pricing. Summary: This is a great machine and while we've been very happy with our Pixie and the associated costs this is a nice upgrade.  It offers more flexibility, easier use, and only a minimally larger footprint.  Our only concern is the increased coffee pod cost and whether the ability to make full size cups of coffee outweigh the added pod costs.  Either way we're going to be staying with the Nespresso system.",Excellent Nespresso machine,Amazon,0

Operation is simple, including making the froth. The design makes for a slim profile which tucks away nicely on my counter and having a moveable water tank is a nice perk so I can easily change the location if I choose. The machine accepts two different size capsules for either coffee or cappuccino. One con with the system is that the capsules aren't as readily available as the Keurig k-cups.

We love Nespresso, but the design of this machine is pretty poor.  It still makes a killer cup of coffee though. This is my second time reviewing a Nespresso maker, but my first chance to use the optional Aeroccino (which is the greatest thing ever) Pros: 1. The water tank can sit to the left, right or behind the unit so you can configure it based on your counter top. 2. Setup is as easy as running the water program one time (tap the brew button 3 times and it runs 16 oz of water through itself and after that it is ready to go). One thing I will note here is to make sure the cup under it can hold enough. Mine didn't and it covered the counter in very hot water. 3. The Aeroccino is amazing - click once to froth milk and warm it up. click twice and it will froth the milk without warming it up. Adding a little less than the line makes for better foam if you want to pretend to do barista art. 4. It makes a cool sound as it opens up to accept pods (its semi automatic going up and down once you flip the handle). 5. The aeroccino is easy to clean and the spinner is held in place magnetically so it comes out and in easy and the rest in non-stick so a good rinse and a little soap and its good to go. 6. Nespresso makes amazing coffee that can not be beat by other coffee pod systems. Cons: 1. I worry about the long term durability of the open and closing auto mechanism - if I do experience any problems I will update this review. 2. My MAJOR complaint about this coffee maker is the shape - it is convex and bulges out right where you need to put your coffee cup. Since the tray to hold your up is contoured to fit a cup, only 1/2 to 2/3 of your cup is actually sitting on the tray. For my larger mugs (which you  need if you plan to add frothed milk), I'm always worried that the cup will fall off the tray. For smaller cups this is not a problem. I really really wish they could contour this the other way, it would seem and act more stable. 3. Nespresso is not a cheap coffee pod, but at the end of the day I believe the coffee quality is worth the cost. The after market pods that allow for refilling when you just want regular coffee are few and far between - I will be experimenting with these in the future and reporting back.  And, Nespresso does offer specials all the time, and they are the cheapest option for purchasing the pods.","Love Nespresso coffee, Not the best machine design, Aeroccino is awesome",Amazon,1
3312,Breville,"December 29, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"This review is for the Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker.  It seems that Nespresso has licensed its technology, and I’ve seen essentially similar machines from Nespresso themselves and DeLonghi. The Breville VertuoPlus is our third coffee maker – yep, we like our morning coffee.  We also have a standard drip machine and a larger, much more expensive Miele coffee/espresso machine. Bottom line:  The VertuoPlus makes a much better cup of coffee than the drip machine, indeed a smooth, delicious cup of coffee that rivals the Miele machine which cost multiple times more. The system is wonderfully accompanied by a sampler pack of various coffee and espresso capsules, to allow you to sample flavors and intensities.  (The match between capsule descriptions and actual capsules could, however, be more straightforward).  I particularly like that the capsules are rated by their coffee strength – from a 2 to a 9 for coffee intensity and body. Another big plus – all the capsules create a delicious crema (a flavorful, milky froth) for both coffees and espressos.  The Miele does, as well, but not any better than the VertuoPlus. Two minor marks against the machine.  Unlike the drip maker or the Miele, you cannot use coffee beans with the VertuoPlus.  (The Miele grinds beans just before brewing, as part of the process for each cup).  Although the pods are “recyclable,” Nespresso has a distinct procedure for doing so, unavailable in our town, and their drop-off centers aren’t within 50 miles of us. The design for the water container also is a bit faulty.  I like to always use fresh water, and taking off and returning the water container often leaves a small puddle on our granite countertop.  I’d be careful if you place the machine on a surface that shouldn’t become damp. One last note: I don’t often drink cappuccino.  The Breville VertuoPlus comes with a separate milk frother – potentially a great addition – which we haven’t used and consequently is not reviewed here.",Terrific coffee from the VertuoPlus Machine,Amazon,1

Not only does it come in a really cool box, but the machine itself is quite cool!.  I also have several appliances from Breville. They make a solid product with an industrial sized cord. I try and avoid reading directions, but this one had a simple one to follow. Plug it in. Rinse the water container, fill it with water and let the machine run a few cycles.  It will use most of the water. After that, pop in a pod and boom! Amazing coffee with a good head of cream on top!  The pod opening is automatic so a tap at the bottom of the arm will open it and a tap at the top will close it. The only thing I would improve would be to make the coffee cup holder a little wider, as it will hold a tall cup, but not a very wide one. Nepresso does hold the market on these pods and so they are not that easy to find, but I knew this!  This frother is deeper than the older one, so it allows less spillage and a better amount of froth.

3315,Breville,"December 17, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"I've been using a Nespresso Pixie and their OriginalLine capsules every day for several months and love it.  This VertuoPlus works differently, and it took me a few days to decide if I like it as well as the Pixie, but in the end - I really do!  It's simple to operate and makes very good espresso/coffee.  There are pros and cons between the VertuoLine and the OriginalLine, IMO, which I'll cover after I talk about this machine in particular. Before I ordered, I read several reviews that talked about the water container leaking all over the counter top, and that made me hesitate before ordering it.  I'm happy to say that mine hasn't leaked one bit.  The container snaps into place securely on the base, and there hasn't been the slightest hint of an issue.  In fact, there have been no issues or frustrations with this machine at all.  I've purchased a few products from Breville, and I'm generally very happy with their gear - and this is not exception. Operating the machine is extremely simple.  One note: as opposed to all of my other pod/capsule machines, the lid on this machine is motor-driven and will not open unless you have the machine turned on.  I first tried to open it when it was off and thought it was broken, but once plugged in, it opened right up with just the slightest upward pressure on the silver bar in front.  Once opened, you pop a capsule into place and gently push down on the silver bar to have the motorized lid close down and puncture the capsule.  Make sure that the water level is above the minimum line, get your cup put into place, and then - just push the button.  Super simple. I'm used to it with the Pixie, but I was very happy that you can push the button to brew the cup before the machine is warmed up, and it will brew when ready.  I love that.  I bought a Keurig Rivo years ago, and it will just beep at you if push the button before it's ready. If you've never owned a Nespresso machine, I would like to say that almost all of their packaging (including the coffee capsules themselves) is recyclable.  I absolutely _love_ that. What I didn't know about the VertuoLine is the different capsule sizes make different cup sizes and that the machines read a code on the capsule to automatically determine the amount of water to use.  You can tailor the cup sizes by adjusting the machine for all capsules of a given size and/or easily brew a bit more for any individual cup.  The capsule sizes range from Espresso (1.35 oz), Gran Lungo (5 oz), Coffee (7.77 oz), to Alto (14 oz).  I've gotten into the habit of brewing two Lungo (3.7 oz) pours from my Pixie into one cup in the morning, and one Coffee from the VertuoPlus is about the same volume...but I will admit that I like the two Lungos better so far, but that might just be because I haven't yet found my favorite flavors from the VertuoLine (which are different from the OriginalLine flavors). The crema is surprising and outstanding.  I expected that in the Espresso size because my Pixie does an amazing job, but I was thrilled to see it in the Coffees, as well.  The quality of the brew out of this machine is fantastic. The machine comes with a sample box with several different flavors to try, with some Coffee capsules and some Espresso capsules.  Although my samples were 'best by' a couple of weeks before I received the machine, they still seemed fresh.  I quite enjoyed some, while not preferring others, so I'm glad that there was a sampler box to save me from buying a whole sleeve of a flavor that I don't like. Speaking of 'sleeves,' that's what Nespresso calls their boxes of capsules.  I encourage you to go to their website to check out the different flavors and sizes available, as well as the prices.  The OriginalLine has more options, but that might change over time.  Nespresso has specials pretty often, such as getting a couple of free sleeves if you order a few (but they pick the flavors of the free ones). If you're into decaf, I'd like to recommend their Decaf Ontuoso Gran Lungo (5 oz).  The sample box came with their two other decaf options (a Coffee size and an Espresso size), but I bought the Gran Lungo and prefer it.  I find it to be very smooth and flavorful.  Of course, it's all personal preference. Compared to the OriginalLine, I find this machine to be quieter than the Pixie but it takes ever so slightly longer to brew.  The Pixie is a simpler machine, which I kind of like.  It's totally manual with only a power button and two buttons for either an Espresso size or a Lungo size.  I like that I can clean the Pixie every day by just brewing a cup without a capsule in place.  With this machine, it's about as easy but it takes longer - you just do the first part of the 'cleaning' process (at least, that's what I've found so far).  Btw, if you aren't used to cleaning one of these by brewing straight water, give it a try - you might be surprised how dark the water is.  As for quality of the hardware, I find both to be quite good. I happen to love how small the OriginalLine capsules are, but I'm sure that I'll get used to these once I figure out where to store them.  The OriginalLine capsules are less expensive, but these aren't that much more and they are pretty comparable per ounce of beverage.  Again, though, I encourage you to check out their website. Overall, I highly recommend this machine.  It's well made, simple to operate, pretty darn quiet, and makes wonderful drinks.","Awesome machine, and as an OriginalLine owner for months, I'm growing to really like the VertuoLine",Amazon,0

The coffee is prepared consistently perfectly in practically no time.  In the morning I put in a pod, push start and by the time I have packed my laptop, lunch and books into my bag the coffee is good to drink.  The coffee is hot but not so scalding you can't drink it immediately.  If you prefer milk in your coffee you will want to spend 30 seconds warming it before you put the cup under the spout. The unit comes with an excellent assortment of coffees which range from a very light roast to blacker than the dark side of the moon.  So, you will be able to find the right brew. Another reviewer made a comment about the water tank leaking.  I have been using it for a couple weeks and I have had no issues whatsoever. The milk frother is also flawless.  It makes perfect hot foam quickly and consistently.  It must be hand washed but it is simple if you rinse it right after making your drink.

I used to think it wasn't possible. I tried and tried, but the syrups and powders always made it taste generic and homemade. Now this, our first ever Nespresso machine, has changed my mind! I'd always heard great things about Nespresso, and they turned out to be true. Yes, it's an expensive treat, for a coffee machine. But I actually think this will save me a lot of money, since I've stopped going to Starbucks ever since this thing showed up. As a stay-at-home-mom with three kids, whom I homeschool, I'm always tired in the morning. And a nice coffee is a luxury and a treat to me, and I treat myself often because my work is hard. But no more packing the kids in the car to go to the Starbucks drive-thru down the street! My iced mochas are home made AND gourmet now. Check out my video for one way to make an iced-mocha. It's certainly not the only way, but it works well for me! In the video review I also go over the machine and how it works. I like that it stores used pods away in the back until full and you can empty all of them at once. I also LOVE that the pods are recyclable! Amazing. Finally, we went to the Nespresso Boutique at our local mall. It's great because they have a coffee bar where you can try any of their flavors to find what you like before buying! As a new customer, they gave us 2 sleeves (10 pods each) free with our purchase of 8 sleeves. So now we have 100 pods ready for the next couple months, which turned out to be about $0.76/each. Way cheaper than the coffee shops! If you're interested in a Nespresso machine, I highly recommend investing in this one by Breville. And the milk frother?! Also amazing! Bye-bye Keurig. To make my iced mocha: 1. Prepare two (or one, if you don't need strong coffee) espresso pod. I use Diavolitto. 2. Pour espresso over 2 scoops plain chocolate ice cream (or more or less depending on your sweet tooth). Shake/stir to melt ice cream and pour over ice. 3. Prepare frothed milk in Aeroccino using cold milk setting. (You could skip this and use plain or no milk.) Pour over espresso/ice cream and ice. Stir, enjoy!",Is it worth the price?

Press the start button and watch it brew. It brews pretty quickly and coffee gets nice and hot. No need to lift the lever to remove the capsule. It does it on its own! When you open the lid it automatically discards it in capsule 'catcher' at the back of machine. That 's a cool feature. I tested the frother for the hot milk and it works really well.

3319,Breville,"December 14, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"Until now, I’ve been satisfied with my Keurig machine, which faithfully delivered hot coffee with little trouble each morning.  However, my upgrade to the Nespresso Vertuo Plus ended up being more surprising than I thought it would be— it turns out that for the last year, I’ve been regularly drinking dirty water first thing upon waking each morning.  There is NO comparing coffee quality; everyday now I enjoy a cup of frothy, delectable bliss. The Vertuo pods are more expensive than the Keurig pods, but are well worth the cost. Nespresso also offers a variety of flavor/strength options. For me, the Nespresso pods increased cost is less important than the improved flavor; others may disagree. This miracle machine takes approximately 20 seconds to heat the water, and then approximately another thirty seconds to brew, yet it makes a hot frothy cup. My favorite thing (other than the great taste) may be the pod disposal system. The Vertuo Plus goes an extra step and neatly disposes of the day’s previous pod into a canister hooked on to the back of the machine—the receptacle can hold more than a week’s worth of pods before it requires emptying.  I’m still used to having to visit my garbage can each day to dump off the spent Keurig pod, and as an American—less wasted time in the morning is good news indeed. Other than great tasting coffee, there are several things that I Iike about my new Nespresso.  I like the look of the coffee maker; it classes up my kitchen counter. And it’s convenient that the coffee tank can be positioned at a 45 degree angle to either the right or left or directly behind the machine itself.  The tank is quick and simple to clean and refill, and the enclosed cup support allows for different cup sizes, from small espresso cups to larger car to-go cups. This version comes with Aeroccino3, which is essentially a milk frother.  A push of the button allows for either hot or cold frothing.  I enjoy using the hot froth option in the mornings when I’m not in a hurry, although frankly—it only takes a second or so to froth the milk and rinse out the unit—my time just happens to be extremely limited in the morning.  I’m very excited about using the cold froth option with iced coffee in the summertime.  While this is a nice add-on, I do want to point out that without using the frother I do notice a nice amount of foam on my coffee from the machine use alone. The bottom line: I would strongly recommend this unit to those who truly love a good cup of coffee.  The small amount of effort that’s required to operate/wait for this coffee to brew does not at all compromise the quality of coffee it produces.  If anything, it’s far superior to any other pod coffee machines that I’ve tried.",Love at first sip....,Amazon,1

3321,Breville,"December 12, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"I have tried out half a dozen coffee makers from Amazon in the last few months and the VertuoLine Deluxe is currently my favorite by far. The first thing you need to decide is whether you want a coffee maker that uses pods or a regular drip maker with grounds. I like the idea of freshly grinding my coffee from whole beans, and how much cheaper it is not to use pods, but the convenience of pods makes the VertuoLine a pretty attractive option. I try to justify the expense and waste that pods create by only using it on the weekends. Setup is very easy and only takes a few minutes of reading the manual to figure out how everything works. It comes with an assortment of pods, and then the Aeroccino is boxed with it in a separate box with instructions, and operates independently from the VertuoLine. For standard coffee, the VertuoLine works much like the Keurig. You fill up the water reservoir, insert the pod, and press the button. The main difference between this and the Keurig is that you don’t have to select a certain cup size. The Nespresso reads the bar code on the bottom of the pod and determines how much water to use and coffee to dispense based on that. You do have the ability to adjust this manually, and then program it for specific coffees, so it will then make future cups according to those programmed specifications. I really like this feature, although the barcodes mean you are committed  into only buying Nespresso coffee and can’t use third party coffees with it (although I’m sure there are ways around this). The assortment of coffees it comes with are pretty nice, although I haven’t found any I like as much as the Starbucks line yet. One thing I was a bit confused about was how to make an espresso. It kept pouring me a large coffee instead of an espresso shot, until I realized the variety pack had specific coffees for espresso, and that if you used those it would pour a single espresso shot. The Aeroccino works pretty well, although it took awhile to get used to. I first tried 2% milk and unsweetened almond milk with it and it completely failed to create any froth. It wasn’t until I tried whole milk and skim milk in it that it finally frothed up and I could start making lattes and cappuccinos.",Best coffee maker I've used,Amazon,0
3322,Breville,"December 11, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,3,"I like this setup as an espresso or cappuccino maker, but as a coffee maker it's not worth the price.  Out of the box the footprint is bigger than my Keurig or a standard coffee pot and that's before you set out the milk frother.  It does a nice automated cleaning routine and it's quiet and clean to use.  The pod slide in easily, you hit a button, the machine reads a bar code on the pod and applies the right setting for your coffee.  You get a shot, a 7.8oz cup or a 14oz mug.  Choose your cup or mug accordingly.  For a shot its great, the 7.8oz is ok. I haven't sprung for the biggest size yet, it wasn't in my welcome pack. Now... there is a cup stand that you pretty much have to use and it floats off the cabinet height.  So if you have a large mug, or a mug that is larger than a normal mug at the top it doesn't work well with this machine unless you take off the cup stand... and then if the machine drips after you walk away you either have to put the cup stand back or clean the counter.  For my machine the pods only release and slide back into the empty pod reservoir about 1/3rd of the time.  Maybe it gets better with use? The milk frother is the best part for me.  In just a couple of minutes you get warm milk, not scalded with some good froth.  I like it for my coffee, and the kids love it for warm frothy milk.  You'll need a small spatula to get out all the froth and it should be something that won't scratch the inside of the frother.  It is also easy to clean. I can't believe it's $100 on the Nespresso site, but it is fun. The pods... so the ones that came with my box set to let me try out the machine had a best by date the same date the box showed up at my house.  I called Nespresso and their response was that coffee doesn't have a best by date.  I asked why they put a best by date on the box and the girl said they had to...  For a $200 coffee set I expected a little more.  Best by date is 9months after the production date if you are interested. Cost to brew is another big factor with this setup.  Other pod based competitors you can get sub $0.40 for a good cup, albeit with no crema.  My old brewer is around $0.10 a cup.  This one is $1-$2 a cup, sole source from Nespresso with no 3rd party venders (yet?) and only one  self pack option .  There is something to be said for a quick cup when you only need one and a lot of variety in brewing, but you might reach your limit before you get to the Nespresso VertuoPlus. Overall if you are a huge coffee guru with plenty of disposable income that specializes in espresso or cappuccino and doesn't go for a full up at home machine this is a great option.  If you drink a lot of coffee, don't care a ton about crema or think $1-$2 for a cup of coffee at home is a bit steep this isn't the set for you.","Nice, but very pricey per cup and a few minor design issues",Amazon,3
3323,Breville,"December 11, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"I became a convert to Nespresso after visits to my aunt's and the ease of making my own coffees in the morning. I bought a Vertuo shortly after for my NYC apartment. Setup was simple and easy like before, just a simple cleaning process and I could already tell from all the visible steam that the liquid was coming out much hotter than my Vertuo. The VertuoPlus fixes my biggest issue with the Vertuo - temperature. On the Vertuo, coffee would never start very hot and would cool down quite quickly. The VertuoPlus puts out coffee at over 160°F. I also appreciate the adjustable water tank so depending on your layout, you can swivel it behind or to either side. Design-wise, it'll take awhile to get used to. I appreciated the symmetrical look of the Vertuo so the large tank to the side feels a bit weird. The Aeroccino 3 is also a nice upgrade from my Aeroccino Plus. I miss the handle a bit but whisks are a bit better for my uses. And the 3 is a bit taller and slimmer, but just as quiet. The machine comes with a variety pack of 12 pods: 8 coffee, 4 espresso. The pods are single use. Believe me, when I was working part time, I tried to get more mileage by trying another cup but it does not work. The pods can appear relatively pricey but I think of it as saving money from going to cafes. Also, in the past year, nespresso.com has more consistently offered free sleeve offers that I've taken advantage of. My favorites are Vanizio, Caramelizio, and Intenso.

Thus it's been collecting dust. Original review: We're big coffee drinkers, and love the Ninja with thermal carafe that we bought last year. This machine makes delicious coffee and espresso at the touch of a button, and the frother makes perfect milk froth, but the cost and limited selection of the capsules makes this for special treats only. I hope this will eventually change. The machine was easy to set up using the quick start guide. I don't care for the water tank design, though. The connection just pops on and it's kind of hinky; I can see how it could flood your counter if you're not careful or fill it up too much. The swing out arm is more fancy than functional and I hope it doesn't break. The Ninja water tank and connection is much better designed and Breville should try to copy that instead. The coffee is very easy to make, like with a Keurig. But unlike Keurig, there's no selection of brands of coffee or other drinks like tea and cocoa. You also can't use refillable capsules. Right now they cost about a dollar each for coffee or about 95 cents each for espresso. That's certainly cheaper than Starbucks but for home brewing, it means Nespresso coffee will be a special treat only. Also be aware that the non-dome-shaped Nespresso capsules won't fit this machine. Honestly I think they should have given away this machine and sold the capsules.",What good is this when pods aren't sold in stores,Amazon,1
3326,Breville,"December 11, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,4,"I have a couple of other Esresspo machines and another Nespresso machine, the Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker. This machine is the same, the only big difference is that this one has a milk frother. See my review below. This is a very nice machine. My husband and I love all types of coffee and welcomed this machine with open arms. We currently have a regular brewer and a Keurig. One would think that this machine is extremely expensive, but if you compare it to the Keurig, it is actually cheaper, and it is actually on sale via Amazon Prime. Once again, in comparison to the Keurig, the pods run about the same as far as price is concerned. You can get them here on Amazon, or you can buy them from the Nesperesso website. They even have a members only program that allow you to get these pods, sometimes for a sale price and other goodies you wouldn't normally be able to obtain. Unboxing: The machine is packaged securely, and it comes with the machine, the water reservoir, the drip catcher and the plug. There are about 4 notches that you can put the drip tray/cup holder on, starting from the bottom to the top. The water reservoir has a suction cup that moves the water from the container into the coffee mechanism. Actual contents: Capsule container, machine, water tank, lid, adjustable water tank arm, adjustable cup support and capsule container. Simple instructions. You'll need to follow the instructions manual and rinse the machine first by running 27 fl oz of water through the machine. Coffee preparation instructions: Fill water tank with water, turn the machine on, place cup under coffee outlet, place coffee pod/capsule (flat side up) in machine, carefully push down lid and hit start button. Things to note: You don't have to force the lid up and down. Once you pull or push softly, it has a soft open and soft close on its own. So too much force may break the mechanism that opens and closes it. When you open the lid to place ANOTHER capsule in, the machine will automatically eject the old one into the pod dispenser. There are three sizes of cups recommended for this machine: Alto-14fl oz, Coffee-7.77fl oz and Expresso 1.35fl oz. If you want to top off your cup, you can simply press the start button once more and a little at a time will flow into the cup. Just make sure you have the proper sized cup. Again, see the attached video for a more visual look at this machine. I might also add that the machine comes with a capsule sampler that includes 12 capsules. The nicely packaged box gives a background and strength of each pod. I'm gathering that all the red pods are decaffeinated related. The flavors run from Intens (and no, that's not spelled  Caramelizi, Elvazi, Giorni, Voltes, Half Caffeinat and Altissi. And before you start wondering if your eyes are playing tricks on you, there are 12 samples, but there are 16 descriptions. The contents of the box also  include instruction manual and a welcome card.",Comes With a Milk Frother Unlike Its Sister Machine,Amazon,1
3327,Breville,"December 10, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"The wife and I love the Nespresso coffee/espresso making system and have been using the  KitchenAid Nespresso Machine  for several years along with the excellent Aeroccino 3 Milk Frother. We obviously jumped at the chance to test the Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus which uses the larger Vertuo capsules. Note: This machine is not compatible with Nespresso Classic capsules. --------------------- ► UNBOXING & SETUP: --------------------- Getting the VertuoPlus set up and operational takes just a few minutes and the machine features a self-cleaning mode that's activated by filling the water reservoir and pressing the top button (with the coffee cup logo) three times in 2-seconds. This changes the outer ring of the machine to an orange color and the self-cleaning mode takes about 5-minutes to complete. Other than that you can figure out the configuration of the machine that works best for your space. This works by swiveling the water reservoir around so that it's directly behind the machine or to either side. I love that Breville designed the machine this way and it makes getting to the water reservoir so easy! The machine also features an easy to adjust cup support system that can support cups of different sizes or be removed completely when filling larger travel mugs. --------------------- ► BREWING: --------------------- The VertuoPlus system is fantastic and works completely automated so that your interaction with the machine is a simple button press (outside of filling the water reservoir or emptying the capsule container). This machine works by reading barcodes embedded in each Vertuoline capsule that tells the machine how much water to use, how fast to spin the capsule and so forth. This really makes brewing the perfect cup that so much easier than any coffee or espresso machine I've used before! From a cold-start to ready for brewing temperature the machine takes approximately 25-seconds. All you need to do is ensure you've placed an appropriately sized coffee cup on the cup support. Cup sizes supported by this machine are: >> Alto: 14-ounces / 414ml >> Coffee: 7.77-ounces / 230ml >> Espresso: 1.35-ounces / 40ml The Vertuoline capsules are sufficiently different in size that it's pretty obvious what capsule you're using and the sampler pack included with the machine has a handy guide on the inside lid to help you get accustomed! The lid and thus access to the capsule compartment is operated by tapping the chrome-accented lid. This automatically raises the entire top of the machine, ejects the old capsule into the capsule reservoir, and readies the machine for another capsule. The entire operation is pretty impressive. --------------------- ► DESCALING: --------------------- I'll only mention this briefly here but the VertuoPlus does feature a full-fledged descaling routine. It's covered in detail in the instruction manual and requires the use of a packet of Nespresso descaling liquid. Descaling the machine takes approximately 20-minutes. --------------------- ► AEROCCINO 3: --------------------- I raved about the Aeroccino 3 when I reviewed my KitchenAid Nespresso machine and I have not changed in opinion about this little milk frother. Put simply, this machine makes perfect hot or cold milk froth every single time and with only the press of a button. I have a traditional espresso machine with a steam wand for frothing milk and honestly, I think the Aeroccino 3 does a better job than I do. The milk froth from this machine is thick, perfectly compact froth and excellent on top of a latte or added to an espresso. The machine does on occasion leak a bit of milk from the lid but that's usually more my fault for not getting the rubber gasket seated properly. Cleaning can also be a bit of a chore but that's a small price for such excellent froth! --------------------- ► VERTO CAPSULES & RECYCLING: --------------------- If you're new to Nespresso then you need to be aware that there can be some sticker shock involved. The capsules for this machine are not exactly inexpensive depending on your view. My wife and I justify the expense by comparing it to getting coffee out which is much more expensive. The quality of the coffee and espresso from this machine is such that it's better than most chain coffee shops at a fraction of the price. Additionally, Nestle provides a mail-in program for recycling used capsules. The bag is free and can hold up to 100 VertuoLine capsules and also ships free via UPS. We simply keep the bag in our kitchen, fill it, and then drop it off at UPS. It's a great way of avoiding the guilt of using a capsule-based system! --------------------- ► CLOSING: --------------------- I've seen a few folks complain about water leaks with this machine. The wife and I have been using ours successfully without any issue for about two-weeks. The coffee, as I mentioned before, is simply outstanding. This is about as easy as it gets for having a perfect cup of coffee or espresso! Recommended!",Perfect Coffee or Espresso Has Never Been Easier!,Amazon,5

The machine couldn't be easier to use, and produces a very full-boded, rich, yet smooth shot with a lot of crema. The Aeroccino works well, but produces more a frothy foam than a smooth, dense microfoam such as what is used in latte art. The downside is that you must use Nespresso Vertuo coffee pods only, and they are expensive and not easy to find. The coffee is very fresh and good quality (although you don't have the kind of choice you do at your local artisanal coffee roaster) and of course, you cannot blend coffees yourself. Also, the Nespresso pods are recyclable.

It's part of our coffee trio (french press, drip, and K-cup). I decided to give Nespresso a try after a couple of years of fighting poor quality Keurig machines that only last a year. The Nespresso unit looks great... it's got a small footprint and a very easy to fill water reservoir (Keurig machines sometimes requires twisting or turning to remove/install the tanks). The unit seems extremely well built, and I absolutely love the motorized opening that automatically disposes of the previous pod. The pod container holds about 10-12 pods before needing to be emptied. It's a simple feature that I find I really appreciate. The VertuoPlus works perfectly... so far. I've been using it a week and have had no problems at all. Flawless operation. The coffee brewed is really good... on average, easily much better then the k-cups. Add the fact that it also brews espressos, the machine is fantastic. It's not as versatile as the Keurig machines though... the Keurigs will allow you to make anywhere from three to five different sizes of coffee using the one-size fits all k-cup. The Nespresso system allows three different sized coffees, but requires two different pods... one for the large and regular cups, and a separate pod for espressos. Not as convenient, but it makes up for it by brewing a much better cup of coffee. The included milk frother is fantastic... it has a wired base that you simply place the frother on to work. It's foams warm or cold. The only moving part in the frothing cup is a small whisk-type spinner that is held in place by a magnet, so cleaning is incredibly easy. Overall, my wife and I have been loving the machine, but it has one big issue that we ran into that is nearly a deal-breaker for us.... the pods themselves. Nespresso doesn't have anywhere near the variety that the k-cups have. You can walk into Bed Bath and Beyond and easy spend ten minutes going through the variety of options you have for the Keurig machines, despite the fact that they only have a fraction of the varieties available. BB&B does sell the Nespresso machines, but does not sell the new line of cups that this particular machine requires... the Vertuoline. The only easy options for us is either ordering from Amazon or Nespresso directly, for anywhere from .85 cents for espresso pods, or $1.10 and up for coffee pods. K-cups are between a third and a quarter of the price. Personally, I find that to be a very steep price for making coffee at home. Overall, we love the machine and the coffee/espressos it makes, but the lack of variety and painfully expensive cost of the pods are a huge reason to return to the Keurig machines. I hope the Vertuoline becomes more popular, and cheaper, over time.",Machine is fantastic... the variety and cost of the pods are near-deal breakers for us,Amazon,5

I’m a long-time Nespresso user with a eight-year old Essenza machine that has seen a lot of use. The new Vertuo Plus produces even better coffee. The Swiss-made VertuoLine capsules are considerably larger than the OriginaLine ones. More coffee, more flavor. They’re fairly expensive, but not when compared to prices at your local coffee shop. The Vertuo Plus is well-engineered and the build quality is excellent. The water tank holds a generous 64 ounces. The brewing process uses Nespresso’s new Centrifusion technology that spins the capsule rapidly during extraction. You have a choice of two capsule capacities. My preference are the Small ones for 1.35 ounce Espresso ($0.95 ea). I also like the larger ones for 8 ounce coffees ($1.10 ea). Each capsule has a barcode that the machine reads to determine the brewing process and amount of water to be used. You can also program the machine to use more or less water if you prefer. A handle on the lid lifts and closes the lid automatically for capsule insertion. With a press of a button, the brewing process begins and is complete in about a minute. The coffee has a creamy layer of crema on top. The used capsules are automatically ejected into a built-in container so they can be disposed of responsibly. The aluminum capsules are recyclable but if you choose, Nespresso also has a no-cost recycling program for them. The VertuoLine capsules are available in a wide variety of intensities. These strengths range from a flavorful and mild 2 out of 10 to a seriously robust 9 out of 10. There are also favored varieties such as caramel and hazelnut and holiday specials like peppermint and licorice. I like the medium-strong espresso blends and have no particular interest in the flavored varieties. However, the possibility of having an assortment available for guests (including decaf) will surely impress them. This deluxe bundle includes the Aeroccino milk frother. It sits on a small induction power stand so the unit itself is waterproof and can be washed. You simply pour in some milk, touch a button, and the milk is heated while a small insert spins producing warm milk and foam to make a Cappuccino. The unit is very easy to clean. A full 8 ounce cup of this coffee is powerful. It will surely get your motor running each morning. However, my favorite way of making coffee is traditional cappuccino/latte - a 1.35 ounce espresso with warm milk and foam.

The other well known pod brand doesn't even come close in terms of taste (but I still have one at my desk at work). The taste of the coffee and espresso was as good if not better than what you get at a coffee shop (certainly beats some of the most well known chains). This unit comes with not only the machine but also the milk frother.  The frothing unit did not come with any instructions and the first time I used this, I didn't notice that there are pictorial instructions on the unit.  It was pretty easy to use though.  You add milk and then push the button on the side for a few seconds to froth the milk.  I then added that to the espresso I made. This unit will only take the Vertuoline pods and there are no other third branded pods that will work in this machine.  Part of this is because there is a  barcode on each capsule which tells the machine the proper temperature and water to use for that pod.  The original Nespresso machine (which doesn't make coffee) uses a traditional pump approach to force the water through the coffee.  The Vertuoline uses centrifugation to spin the water through the capsule and extract the coffee.  This gives a pretty foamy crema compared to the original. Since I usually will brew a coffee over an espresso, this is a better choice for me.  If you are only interested in espresso, the original line may be a better choice since there are third party pod choices out there (the vertuoline pods are pricier than the original).

Nespresso VertuoPlus coffee makers use a unique and superior method of brewing found in no other coffee maker. Most coffee makers use some variation of pouring hot water over coffee grounds. The Nespresso method runs the coffee in a miniature centrifuge to force hot water through the coffee under high pressure. The result is a rich coffee with a flavorful crema that is the equal or better to any espresso you've ever tasted. It is super easy to use-- just turn it on and drop a pod into the machine. Seconds later you have the best home-brewed coffee you've ever had. Another distinctive with Nespresso is that there is a bar code on each pod that individually adjusts the brewing time and other factors for each specific coffee blend. There is one significant drawback: the pods are only sold by Nespresso, are limited in availability, and cost two to three times more per serving than Keurig. However, if coffee is your passion, then I think you will agree the Nespresso is worth the extra cost. This set also includes Nespresso's Aeroccino 3, which sells for $99 separately on the Nespresso site. It takes cold milk and heats it to the ideal temperature for mixing in coffee in only a minute.

That’s what these are…right? There was a time when Folgers was popular – “best part of waking up…”. So here we are, I thought k-cups were just introduced but maybe Nespresso will be the next best thing. I for one have never been impressed with k-cups. The quality of the coffee is inconsistent among all the brands and the flavor was never right. So, what’s my preferred way of starting my mornings? Just a simple pour-over of my favorite grinds. I can make it as strong or flavorful as I want. Now here we are, the Nespresso world. I will first admit that it is more “premium” than other instant coffees. I have to give credit to where it’s due. Breville has invested in making the perfect cup from the perfect at-home machine. From flavor to texture, the machine along with the pods (they call them capsules) will brew a justifiably good cup of coffee. While adding the right amount of froth to the perfect temperature, I was impressed by the coffee capsules. They were nice to include a “welcome package”. That’s good because I couldn’t find any at my local Target, Walgreens, or Costco. Looks like Nespresso and Amazon are the sites to shop from. I’m guessing there’s some patented technology here at play (or other brands haven’t caught on) because I calculated the prices and it can be between 90 cents to $1.20 per capsule. K-cup pods are half the price. But back to the technology piece, the capsules have barcodes that instruct the machine to brew, pour, serve the right amount. An espresso capsule for an espresso shot while a coffee capsule for a cup of coffee. Same goes for tea. Bravo, Breville a smarter coffee maker for the 21st century. I wouldn’t have expected any less.

3342,Breville,"December 4, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"I love this thing.  I'm a Nespresso OriginalLine fan but this did address a couple of, well, issues I had.  More on that in a minute. Main thing to get with Nespresso, especially the VertuoLIne, is that while it is very premium coffee it's not going to necessarily take the place of a high end barista.  But it's a HOME unit and it is undoubtedly the best I've ever tasted at home...and more to the point I found it better than what I've gotten at more than a few coffee shops. So, in terms of operation this requires Nespresso Vertuo pods.  These differ from the OriginalLine pods but also offer more flexibility.  The OriginalLine can get you a Lungo, but this format lets you go from Ristretto all the way up to what I call American size coffee...a traditional cup.  This did address one nit I had with my Pixie, in that when I have guests over they don't necessarily like Espresso and I had to keep a second coffee maker on standby.  Here, I don't need to do that, and I appreciate the nod to utility. Anyway, the Vertuo system does NOT use a pump to push water through the coffee, and this is the single most glaring thing that will be noticeable to espresso aficionados.  It uses a centrifugal force system instead, meaning water is injected into the pod and it spins said pod very rapidly to mix water and coffee, after which it is dispensed.  In the cup I don't think there's much of a difference, frankly - it is espresso, complete with crema, and it works.  On the other hand, the extraction method means you get crema in American sized coffee too, and for some guests that was a bit startling.  However, the truth is in the cup and once tasted, they loved it. This system does run much more quietly than my OriginalLIne machine, which relies on a traditional pump. Anyway, operation is very easy - just pop in a pod and push the button.  Bar codes on the Vertuo pods tell the machine what size to make, how fast to spin, what temperature water to use, and so on...so it's very easy.  Certain settings, like pour length, can be modified so I appreciate that flexibility.  And it works.  I like easy operation when I want, or more flexible if I find a pod that tastes better with more (or less) water. The Aeroccino device included with the machine is also fantastic - I found it works best with very cold milk, but it warms and froths things up inside of two minutes.  It's also very easy to clean. So there we are - it's a great direction that Nespresso is going with this, and with this machine there aren't many coffee drinks you can't make.  I do hope that the variety of coffees in the Vertuo format expands as much as the OriginalLine has...there are some coffees (like Kazaar) that I love and aren't in Vertuo...yet.  But the format is great, it easily brews high premium coffee in a flash, and it looks good doing it.  I use this thing several times a day and it's been quality every time.  It's a fantastic machine, making fantastic coffee.  I love it.",I love it,Amazon,0
3343,Breville,"December 2, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,3,"Summary: A lot of work to create a mediocre cup of coffee. Keurig is tastier and easier to use. Long review: I was really excited to receive this product, as I consider myself a bit of a coffee conoussieur (sp?) if you will. I've had my faithful Keurig for a few years (well, many Keurigs; they tend to break once a year). Before that, I was a fan of the coffee pot, and I drink instant and Starbucks, etc., etc. This product seemed SUPER fancy, and I like my coffee fancy, so I was, as I said, excited. First off, it is very hard to put together. It took me a long time of staring at the instructions and at the thing itself to figure out where to put that water tank. Then I went through the cleaning process. I didn't realize it would brew 3 CUPS of coffee in the cleaning process, so I had to keep dumping out old water and hurriedly putting my mug back under this thing. The cleaning is pretty automated, so no worries there. Having a cup was similar to Keurig, you put water in, put the cup in, get coffee. My main critique is that the water tank is so large and there are no measurements on it, so hard to figure out how much water you need. Oh, and the coffee itself, isn't really worth the effort. It is marginally better than instant and not as good as Keurig. It does come with built in milk, I guess, or cream in the cartridge, so your coffee won't come out totally black like it does with Keurig. But you should still add a little milk to it if you want it creamy. The taste did not bowl me over for such a high-end brand. The milk frother is absolutely useless. You aren't going to get luxurious cappucino. Only hot milk that's a little frothy. Maybe you have to use it a few times to get cap like frothiness? I'm not sure. The instructions are not clear. This certainly is not worth spending hundreds of dollars on or buying the expensive cartridges online or in Soho, NY for. I'm keeping it in case my Keurig breaks, but I'd be pissed if I paid money for this. A rip off, and I was exhausted by the time I got done figuring out how to put this together and make a cup of coffee.",Not worth the time or money. Tastes only slightly better than instant and really hard to figure out how to use.,Amazon,4
3344,Breville,"December 1, 2017","Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by Breville, Black",B01MSACZGH,5,"Have only just started using this, so we are still learning the ins and outs.  Easy to use out of the box.  Instructions for set up and first run are helpful.  Tank is easy to fill.  Pods are easy to use.  A nice assortment of pods came with the machine.  The best part? This makes an impressively good cup of coffee.  I had assumed this was just a different looking Keurig type machine.  I'm not sure what tech is different, but the coffee is so much better.  The only downside is that it is more expensive per cup than my old Mr. Coffee.  We haven't even tried out the Aeroccino milk foamer yet.  That will happen in the morning.  If you enjoy lots of different flavors and drinks other than coffee, this probably isn't for you.  If you love coffee, espresso, and don't want to fuss with other machines, you will love this.",Ooh...the crema,Amazon,0

So when the chance to try this machine came up, I took it without hesitation even though I have and use a variety of other machines already. There is a lot to love about this Vertuo Plus, from the moveable tank, one button operation to it having a built in cleaning mode and the very nifty way it opens and closes with just a touch. However for me the bottom line is the coffee, all the bells and whistles are meaningless if the coffee comes out bad. Thankfully this machine not only looks impressive but it also makes an amazing cup of coffee or espresso, it is rich and bold without being harsh or acidic. The addition of the aeroccino3 makes adding a foamy layer of froth super easy. Now to a bit of a downside. The machine uses coded capsules so you are stuck as far as choices when it comes to coffee, no making your own blends, and the capsules are a bit spendy for at home coffee. Overall I really like it, not my favorite but it is impressive, if there was a way to customize the capsules at home I would like it even more.",Very modern machine,Amazon,0

The coffee was strong, fresh and full bodies.  The machine really is one:  It won't open up until you turn it on. I have never used a Nespresso machine before.  When you plug it in and press lightly to open it, it really has a smooth, solid sound and feel to it.  As if it tells you, 'just put in the pod, I do the rest'.  Kinda cool Even cooler, when you are finished and open the machine back up, it automatically ejects the used pod into the rear container.  What I liked most about it:  Super easy to use; great look; really good cup of coffee.  What I didn't like: The awkward positioning of the water tank, although it gives flexibility, you definitely want to give this a decent footprint space in your kitchen due to the water tank; the lack of size settings for small or large cups of coffee.  That is a big one for me.  It makes a strong cup of coffee and yes, I can use the excellent Aeroccino 3 Milk Frother it comes with, but I wish they had three settings for 8oz, 12oz and 16oz.  The milk frother is easy to use, made an excellent latte and is solid and also cool looking.

I received this Nespresson VertuoPlus Delux Coffee and Expresso making free in exchange for an honest review. I am always in the market for a new coffee maker, I go though them at a rather fast pace. So I did not expect the one I am using to last much longer, I set this one up as well. My other one for pots of coffee and this one for cups of coffee, expresso and there coffee drinks one cup at a time. This is Designed for use with Only with Nespresso capsules, you can get them at their website or on the phone. It comes with 12 capsules coffee, alto and expresso included.

You can brew cups in three sizes 1.35 ounces for expresso, 7.7 and 14 ounces for coffee and other coffee drinks. It has a motorized head and Moveable (60 oz) water tank that swivels out or stays behind the machine based on space.

One thing to be aware of- this is a new-ish Nespresso line that takes different shaped pods from standard Nespresso machines.  The pods that fit this machine are expensive- around a dollar per pod.  There don't seem to be cheaper brands making pods in this shape yet.  Right now you are stuck with what Nespresso produces.  If this is not an issue for you, this machine creates a very nice cup of coffee.  It comes with the milk heater and froth machine, so you can make a latte or a foam-topped coffee, if you wish.

This one has corrected the heating issue which makes the coffee much hotter.  But I am having issues with the tank leaking.  From research online I have found others encountering the same issue.  I just got off the phone with Nespresso customer service and they acknowledged the issue but informed me there is a specific way to align the tank connection to prevent leaking.  Although I do not see how the tank can be aligned any differently Nespresso agreed to sent me pictures showing how to do it.  I will share once I get the images and confirm it is the fix for the issue.  Hopefully this helps others. **** UPDATE - 7/3/17 **** Never received any pictures from Nespresso regarding the issue of the leaking water tank. So I called back. The customer service rep I interfaced with the second time was extremely helpful and nice. She was simply going to replace the machine for me directly from Nespresso but because of Father's Day weekend just passing they were out of stock. She said I could either wait for a couple of weeks and they would send me one as soon as it was back in stock or I could have Amazon send a replacement. Since Amazon had it in stock I decided to go ahead and request a replacement. Amazon had a new one to me within 2 days. The new one has worked great with no water leaks. I waited before updating my comments here to make sure there were no leaks after a week's use. The old one has been shipped back.

They promptly sent me a replacement and during the overlap I was able to look at these items together. I had ordered the K741 because I have low cabinets - a little under 14 inches. The KB741 didn't fit under my cabinets, but the K741 did. And I wanted a good coffeemaker both for me and something straightforward for houseguests. I was afraid that the K741 setup, with the brew basket sitting right on top of the carafe, would seem too janky. But it's just fine. I found it to be even better than the KB741, which has a rigid mount to set the brew basket on. Because: right after you're done brewing, how do you control drips? The KB741 brew basket has a switch inside you can use to stop the flow (and the K741 basket doesn't), but then you (and your houseguests) have to remember to make sure the switch is open when you brew - else, disaster. And if you're grabbing your coffee right after brewing is done, you end up extracting the brew basket and the carafe separately to carry them to a sink or trash can. Whereas with this model -- the K741 -- the brew basket is on top of the carafe, so it's easier to carry as a unit.

Unfortunately the reviews stating the materials feel cheap are true. The carafe is thin glass and flimsy plastic, and the other removable parts are cheap feeling as well, but mainly the carafe bothered me most. This has the ability to make great coffee but was exchanged for personal convenience more than anything. In order to brew the coffee you must place the basket on the carafe then slide it under the drip/shower arm. Then remove the whole carafe and brew basket and put on a separate lid in order to pour the coffee. The KBT has the basket situated separately from the carafe so you can just pull the carafe away to pour. Also, the hot plate shuts off after 100 minutes. The KBT or any metal carafe version keeps the coffee hot 6+ hours. The plastics used on the KBT also feel sturdier than the K. This version does not have an adjustable brew basket switch for half carafe or pre infusion brewing, so you're stuck having to make a full pots worth of grounds every time otherwise risk getting under brewed weak coffee. The KBT has the half carafe switch on the brew basket.

Short of using a french press and using a manual conical burr grinder, I didn't think that making excellent tasting coffee at home was even possible. I purchased this Moccamaster Technivorm coffee maker on Prime day after disappointing and poor experiences with KitchenAid, Capresso, Cuisinart and many other brands; I guess that the industry thinks its reasonable to expect the consumer to have to buy a new maker each year.  Online research about all the other similar coffee makers led to several reviews where this product was praised for brewing coffee at the correct temperature; this brewer wears a certification award label from some prestigious european institution. The facts are quite plain: 1. The coffee quality is excellent. I used some stale pre-ground coffee with my first use and was absolutely amazed. To be honest, this is just a fancy pour-over machine that keeps the water at the perfect temperature, and makes sure that the grounds don't become bitter from over brewing. Either way, the result is amazing. 2. Keep in mind, you are paying for the older 'Homeline' model where the brew basket just sits on top of the pot. This is only slightly annoying... if you want to spend the extra money where the brew basket sits suspended off of the pot, then you should invest the extra $30-45. 3. This is not a fancy coffee maker. The only feature that you get is on on switch with an auto-off feature that will shut everything off in 100 minutes. 4. It is European, and is handmade in the Netherlands. If you are looking for 10 full U.S cups look elsewhere. You will get about 40 ounces and that's it. 5. This is exceptionally fast and quiet. To brew a full pot takes 4-6 minutes; usually 5. I was amazed when I first used it and didn't even know it was on. You basically just have to go back in 5 minutes.... If the coffee pot is full and the water reservoir is empty, then it is done; there is no beep or other indicator. So if you want great coffee at home, buy this! Buying a large bag of Starbucks at Costco, or a unique roast from a local store ground in a matching Moccamaster grinder will give you an excellent result. Sometimes, you just get what you pay for.",I didn't think that making excellent tasting coffee at home was even possible,Amazon,8

I just could not justify the expense coupled with the hassle of the monster-cord.  If you aren't concerned about the cord or the expense, buy it! -- I'm of Finnish background, so my coffee is important to me.  When my last one went on the fritz, I went on a research binge. I always read reviews, and I found the reviews for this product helpful. Plus, someone who is a bigger coffee snob than me insisted that Moccamaster is the best brand.  (I hadn't even heard of it before.)  So, here goes. It does make coffee FAST. It is attractive, in that engineering-marvel kind of way.  (You can watch the water boil up the little tube, which is different.....and pretty cool.)  The coffee is indeed tasty.  But I am on the edge about keeping it, for four reasons:  1. I'm undecided whether these advantages justify the expense. Having just unexpectedly spent mucho bucks on plumbing issues, I feel a bit guilty about spending this much on a 'cool' coffee maker.  2. I can't really tell if the coffee is hotter. I do use creamer so that is one factor.  But I have tested it without. I just don't see it. 3.The huge industrial cord is a pain to store out of sight.  4. I miss a programmer. Granted, this unit makes coffee very quickly.  But I like to wake up to fresh coffee, without having to make any fuss.  By the way, this model does have auto-shutoff, which is good.  There seems to be some confusion about this.  And I don't notice a 'burnt taste' after the burner has been on for an hour.  One other thing...I ordered this because it was the least-expensive Moccamaster available, but I wondered about the glass carafe.  I usually use a thermal one, because I sip coffee all day long.  I've now decided that coffee from a glass carafe is indeed better-tasting than from a thermal one.  I guess there is something to that 'metal taste' after all.  You know how you don't realize the impact of something until it's gone?  That's the case here.  Bottom line:  In spite of my reticence about cost and other factors, I recommend you try this unit.  If cost were not a factor, I would keep it for sure.","I'm a fan, but still may return",Amazon,6

Previously, I was a militant anti-drip-coffee drinker, preferring instead my old-fashioned Farberware percolator. But after numerous issues with the Farberware, namely the lack of consistency (some pots = great! others = weak undrinkable swill, with no apparent root cause), I started looking for a replacement and settled on the Technivorm. While some people may balk at the price of the Technivorm line, this is one of those times where more $ = better product. The fact that the entire boiler apparatus is solid copper, the boiler riser tube is tempered glass, and the entire assembly is brushed aluminum is worth the price of admission alone. The whole thing just feels solid, from the weight of it to the fat 12 gauge power cord. I have no doubt that it is going to last decades. As for the coffee? Head and shoulders above any other coffee I've had previously, including the percolator. Way more flavor, way less acidity. It also seems to pull out a ton more caffeine - a single 12 oz travel mug keeps me going way past lunch now, whereas before I would need another cup after 12:00 to stay awake. Plus, it uses less coffee (3 scoops) to make that 12 oz as compared to my percolator (5 scoops!). The only downsides with this particular model that I've found are the fact that the filter basket is made of plastic (would prefer metal or glass) and that said filter basket sits directly on top of the carafe. This means you have to wait until the brew cycle has completed before pouring your first cup. On the plus side, this also means that you are highly unlikely to leave the grounds sitting in the basket overnight, since you have to take it off to get at the brewed coffee you might as well empty it.",Fantastic coffemaker!,Amazon,2

The first Technivorm has been in use by me since 2001 and now used by my daughter. I only changed for the color of a new kitchen re-design.  I am a home-roaster ( for testing beans and roasting for my whole family) and I have a commercial roastery as well.  I know great coffee, and folks this makes excellent coffee for the home environment (you will need to play with the grind size to get things perfect).  The design is simple yet elegant for the price.  I tested extraction  temperature to be correct.  I tested amperage and extraction time and found the unit is more efficient than any of the industrial coffee makers I use in my business.  The simplicity of design makes for an easy clean up job.  I will go so far as to say this will get you as close to 'French Press' quality as you can get without the muss..  I like my house quiet in the morning and this makes no brewing noise, so that is a real bonus for me.  This unit has an auto shut off that turns the unit off after 100 minutes, so there is no need to worry about it when you run off to work or play. The power cord is overkill but also gives it that industrial feel.  The power cord is heavy enough to run three of these -big smile- without a loss in electrical efficiency. Some reviews on here complain of 'the use of too much plastic in the design, for the price'.  Those same people would probably complain of it weighing too much if were made solid polished gold... One person complained that the #4 Cone Permanent Coffee Filter will not fit.  This is not true, and they may have been dumb enough to try using it upside-down.  I recommend a permanent type, gold plated filter for better extraction of coffee oils that you don't want stolen by a paper filter.

The warmer has only one temp but I turn it off and empty the glass carafe immediately into a heated glass thermos (German made Rotpunkt (rose glass)) that holds the hot temp for several hours. It is a good 'thermos'. All parts can be easily washed in hot sudzy water or just rinsed. A few quibbles: the plastic filter holder is not sized to exactly fit a standard #4 Melitta filter paper as well as it should. Minor issue, but why not make it fit a standard filter that they include in the box?  Second, the handle on the carafe is rather flimsy feeling. After checking with the seller, all the Technovorm glass carafes have the 'half' thick handle. It looks as if half the handle lengthwise was just missing in manufacture or they forgot to include the back half. Another minor issue but why not give us a handle to grip for an additional 15 cents.

3437,Technivorm Moccamaster,"August 16, 2012","Technivorm Moccamaster 59712 K Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Matte Silver",B00QKKYEX8,5,"I purchased this Technivorm coffee maker (the silver version) about a year and a half ago after poor experience with KitchenAid pro-series units (which are no longer offered). Researching coffee makers on-line led to several reviews where this product was praised for brewing coffee at the correct temperature, in accordance with certification standards of some sort, and lots of other gushing about how great it is. I just wanted a good quality, reliable machine to brew good coffee, and I don't want to have to replace it every 2 years. The coffee quality is excellent and I suppose that has something to do with the temperature of the water, which is stated to be just under boiling (200 degrees F). The lid of the coffee pot incorporates a hollow mixing tube that is intended to ensure that the coffee mixes as it drips into the pot, to avoid stratification. it brews almost silently and is very quick. This all works perfectly and without any fuss whatsoever. It is not a fancy coffee maker; it is somewhat industrial in appearance, has no timer, just the on-off switch and a separate switch to control the plate that keeps the pot heated once brewing is complete. One of the reviews that I read says that the styling has not changed since it was introduced in the 1960's. That appeals to me. It just does what is necessary, and my desire is that when the time comes to make repairs, it will be possible to get replacement parts and keep it in service. I am hopeful that the simplicity of the unit will mean that it will be reliable over time. You should be aware that this machine is designed for Europe and does brew less than typical U.S. built coffee makers. It will brew 10 'European' cups, or 40 ounces of coffee. A U.S. coffee maker with 12 cup capacity will brew 60 ounces of coffee, or 1.5 times as much as the Technivorm. The plastic parts are acceptable quality although in my unit the plastic control that is supposed to regulate the drip did break. I simply removed it and left it at what would be the full open position anyway. If you like good coffee, grind your own beans (I do), and want something that is supposed to brew coffee at the proper temperature in order to achieve the best taste, then I think this is a very good quality product. You might have noticed that both Williams-Sonoma, and Sur la table, are promoting Technivorm coffee makers now, so it has hit the mainstream - which means that if you want something unusual that nobody else has seen before, you'll probably need to find a more obscure product! UPDATE to my original review: Technivorm has recently released a new model brewer which has a larger 64 oz capacity and so is more comparable (in size) with 'standard' U.S. coffee brewers. At the moment I think that it is only available from Williams-Sonoma. The styling is also modernized a bit with a cylindrical design, and there may be other improvements. I recommend checking out that new model before making a purchase decision. For my part, if I was to purchase a new coffee maker now, I would get the new Technivorm model with the larger capacity. This is an excellent coffee maker and the increased capacity resolves the only inconvenience of the present model in my opinion.","Excellent Coffee Brewer - just know that it is 2/3 the capacity of typical ""US"" brewers",Amazon,28

When the first one seemed not to be brewing quite as hot (after several years of use), I immediately knew I would have to have another one.  This is the best coffeemaker I've ever owned.  If I ever switch to another brand, it will only be because of the thermal carafes.  Their quality is not up to the standard of the rest of the coffeemaker (I think I am on my fourth carafe, over the years.)  They say they're guaranteed to keep your coffee hot for 120 minutes after brewing - but I would suggest that 'hot' needs to be defined, because there is a distinct loss of temperature after a half hour or so.  It's still 'hot,' but not like you might wish.  Some Japanese airpots that I have owned do a much better job of maintaining heat.  As soon as Moccamaster has made their thermal carafes to that quality, I would say that this would be a 5-star coffeemaker.  Still and all, it's worth the price, if you don't let your coffee sit TOO long! Actually, I should add that I'm writing about the Moccamaster that has the 40-oz carafe - not the big one that is pictured here.

Copper is the best medium for heating food prep water without the 'issues' and shorter lifespan of aluminum.  Try to find another brewer in this or a lower price range that has a copper heating element.  Those of you that have studied the causes of early onset dementias will understand the issues with using heated/cooled aluminum in concert with food preparation.

I would rather pay more for a beautifully engineered hand-built coffee brewer that allows the manufacturer to support employees and their families rather than additional automation in a country with continuing human rights abuses.  The brewer is SERVICEABLE with replacement parts readily available.  Remember when certain popular European coffee makers sold around the USA were actually made in Europe with replacement parts available, the Moccamaster harkens back to that time with even better quality.  If a coffee maker with this build quality was made in the USA, I would have bought it... The cost differential for this volume 15 'standard' cup brewer is minimal as of this writing.  We entertain fellow coffee drinkers frequently and the appreciation spans an entire family now.  The CDT Grand brews in under eight minutes, super fast!

Wait 30 minutes to an hour and my carafe comes out looking perfectly clean, almost brand new!

This product does just that.  I put in 7.5oz of freshly ground coffee (a bit more than a full cup) to a full load of water and while that's still a bit light it brews a much fuller tasting pot of coffee for that amount of water than any other brewer I've used. As for the quality of the brew, this machine really does the job.  If I want things a bit stronger I'll close the value for 30+ seconds so the grounds are fully immersed.  The brewing is much faster than most machines so there is much less likelihood of over extracting the bitter qualities of your beans. My coffee street cred: I used to brew coffee like tea: 4.5 minutes immersed in water, one minute to get it thru a paper filter into a carafe.  I controlled both time and water: bean ratio.  I wasn't so wild about nursing the task for almost 6 minutes, esp. after the wife said she wasn't going to do it half of the time anymore. So we needed a machine.

When I saw the Moccamaster CDT Grand, I did not hesitate for a second! As one of the half-dozen, or so, automatic drip coffeemakers approved by the SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) as meeting their criteria for optimal brewing, the Technivorm Moccamaster should be high on the list of anyone seeking the best coffee obtainable from an automatic drip coffeemaker. The only minor quibble I have with the Technivorm is that I find the large paper filters a little awkward to get really centered in the filter basket. This has not caused a problem, but I have to fiddle with it a bit before dumping in my ground coffee. Some might fault the lack of automated features. The coffeemaker cannot be set to automatically brew at a preset time. Besides making excellent coffee, the Technivorm is exceptionally easy to use and, especially, to clean-up after use. Highly recommended! ***** UPDATE: Having used the CDT Grand Moccamaster daily for a year now, I would like to add two related comments that might be helpful to to a prospective purchaser. Several times during the year when my wife was away, I pulled out my older, smaller Technivorm, a KBT 741 I think it is, and have to say I actually prefer the smaller coffeemaker. It seems to me that it is a tad easier to use and clean-up after use. You might think of it as the difference between driving a nice tight sedan and driving a long-wheelbase pickup. Also, in reading the FAQ's on Technivorm's website, I stumbled on the following: 'Why doesn’t the Grand Brewer have graduated liter/cup markings on the cool water reservoir?' 'The Grand models were designed for small offices or the entertaining home and must brew a full carafe each and every time to meet Golden Cup standards. The flat-bottom, commercial type, brew-basket (filter), needs sufficient coffee bed depth and water ratio to assure essential saturation and extraction.' While I remain delighted with the CDT Grand, still rate it 5 stars, unless you absolutely need and will use the larger capacity of this coffeemaker, I would recommend one of the smaller Moccamasters.",About as good as an automatic drip coffeemaker gets!

First, the flat basket is an improved design over the cone and encourages better, more even saturation/extraction of the grounds. On the Grand, I'll use the drip-stop closed for the initial bloom, agitate once, then open the flow and let the machine do the rest. The grounds stay saturated through the rest of the brew cycle leaving me with coffee as close to my vacuum brewer as I can get with a drip. The grand is not effortless, but it's close and produces excellent results. For electric coffeemaker over 8-10cup capacity, the TechV Grand is the hands-down choice if you favor fully developed coffee flavor over automation. Tip: I ended up ordering Bunn 9-3/4' in diameter x 4-1/4 commercial filters - a 1000 pack for less than 100 branded filters. Bunn uses an elemental chlorine-free (ECF) bleaching method to ensure there is no detectable level of dioxin - something the Tech filters do not indicate.

I like my coffee more on the acidic side.  This machine makes what I would call a solid 'old school' cup of coffee.  Strong, bitter, dark.  Sure you can mess with grind side and go from an espresso consistency all the way to basically a tea, but if you just let the machine do its thing, then the flavor profile remains essentially the same. If you want that small coffee shop (think Blue Bottle) kind of pour over coffee, you really have to work AROUND what this machine does.  You have to give it more time to bloom.  You have to close it for a bit of immersion brewing.  You have to turn it off and on to control water flow.  Stir the grinds.  Stop it before the bitter end dregs (the clear thin stream of pure caffeine) come out.  Etc, etc.  You basically have to do the same stuff you would do with a manual pour over... so all the machine ends up being is... an electric kettle.  Which you can get for half the price, or even way less. All that being said, it works fine, just doesn't do what I want without a lot of manual messing around which I can do just as well with other things.  Other things that are also way easier to clean and store and move around. But if you like an old school coffee, or a Starbucks, or French roast, then this is a cool machine that does a good job for that.  My 3-star rating is only because it advertised 'maximizing flavor and aroma' which I interpret as something different.

Well, I only use a coffee machine for entertaining, not every day. Unfortunately, that means stagnant water could end up sitting in the boiler for days or even weeks at a time unless I remember to turn the whole machine upside down over the sink to empty the tank after using it. I also noticed the showerhead only distributes water in a narrow channel over the filter leaving a groove down the middle of the grounds bed when finished. Considering how the showerhead design is supposed to be one of the Moccamaster's selling points, I found this uneven distribution of water surprising and rather disappointing. There are ways to improve the saturation with manual intervention, but for me the whole point of an automatic brewer is to handle the coffee making by itself when we're busy entertaining so I'd prefer not to have to do that. I really expected to love and keep the Moccamaster. The praise it gets for its build quality, aesthetics, speed and temperature precision are well deserved, but it turned out to not be the best choice for our needs.","Beautiful, but not the best for just occasional use",Amazon,5

I purchased this to replace my Bonavita BV1800TH which served me faithfully for 6yrs & 3 months..R.I.P. :’(  The newer Bonavita models aren’t getting nearly the reviews that they were getting 6 years ago so I just couldn’t pull the trigger on another. I’ll start by saying; I’ve been suffering some major anxiety over the price. I’m trying to calm myself with the knowledge that, like my deceased BV, this investment will (hopefully) prove itself over the years. A point to consider; A coffee maker can only do just so much with what it’s given to work with. I burr grind my coffee beans (French roast) immediately before brewing and add a pinch of sea salt. My water is tap that’s run through a 9 stage filter. This gets a 5+++ for taste. My BV made the best home brewed coffee I’d ever had until now. I honestly have no idea how this coffee maker could make such an improvement, but it does. I like my coffee strong but smooth and I got that with the BV but somehow this takes my coffee to a level that I didn’t even know existed. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours as long as you switch to the “travel” lid. If you’ll be pouring most of the coffee in a fairly short time, there’s probably no need to switch lids. I used to pre-heat the carafe on my BV but it doesn’t seem necessary with this one. Yes, you can pour with the brewing lid - just turn it to line up the rounded “slots” toward the pour direction, the same as you would with the travel lid. I’ve gotten good grounds saturation and a proper “bloom”. Some reviewers had a problem with dry grounds. As some people said; their machine might need descaling or cleaning, but it could also (upon examination of the “works”) be a problem if the machine isn’t level or if the arm that delivers the water over the basket isn’t firmly seated. Be aware of the reservoir size. My BV was the “8 cup” model which would actually yield 5-6 12oz cups. This Techi is a “10 cup” model which yields the same amount as the BV did. All that being said, why did I only give it 4 stars?, the functionality. I would have expected a more user friendly design for the price. I understand that all the pieces and parts will aid in cleaning and upkeep but some aspects of the design just seem useless if not downright idiotic. ***Please note my model as the features vary*** 1) The thin plastic base plate that’s only held in place by the weight of the machine. Move the machine for brewing (which I do because it’s so close to the underside of my cabinets) and it comes off which requires fiddling to get it lined up and back on. I totally removed the plate which doesn’t seem to serve any purpose other than to keep any residual drips off from the counter. 2) The flow control on the brew basket also seems useless. I set it to the half flow setting, just to try it, and it caused the basket to overflow and spill grinds into the carafe. The closed setting, which I tried to use to keep the basket from dripping on the way to the sink, didn’t stop the drips, even after waiting. 3) The bottom of the brew basket isn’t flat. Yes, you can set it in it’s holder while you’re adding the coffee grinds but if I’m going to knock it over (which isn’t a rarity for me) I’d rather knock it over at counter level and contain the mess, rather than from 12” up and propel the mess half way across the kitchen. I haven’t done this, yet, but it’s only a matter of time. 4) No hinged lid on the water reservoir. Not a big deal until it’s added to all the others. 5) Removeable water arm. Great for cleaning but needs to be removed to dump grounds into the brew basket then replaced. If you don’t remove it you need to find some other way to support the brew basket. See # 3 6) Brew basket cover / lid isn’t part of the machine. I don’t think there’s any way it could be attached when you consider the other aspects of the design. 7) There’s no formed pour spout on the carafe which makes the flow of coffee wider because it lacks the funneled direction that a spout gives. You need to watch your pour speed and aim if your cup is tall and narrow. None of these issues are a deal breaker but ARE frustrating when you need your coffee fix before facing the most simple tasks but you won’t get your coffee fix until you build your coffee maker. **This review is my honest opinion and I received nothing in exchange for it.",Mostly great!,Amazon,16

We grind 71 g using an Oxo grinder, which automatically weighs/measures the amount, which is so easy.  We fill the Moccamaster just over the top mark with water, and are ready to go after placing/rinsing the paper filter and pouring the grounds in.  We find the parts top notch, easy to clean, and I like being able to see/clean everything.  Also, the design of the basket is great, as it has a squared off bottom, so sits easily on the countertop for when I put the coffee in.  In our old pot you had to either place the filter in the filter holder/cone area, and risk dropping a few grounds of coffee back in the water area, or hold the filter holder in one hand while you added coffee in the other hand.  With the Moccamaster filter being filled off of the machine, there is no chance of dropping a few grounds in the water.  The design of the location of the filter also prevents coffee grounds from overfilling in the basket and getting grounds inside the water heating area.  We did overfill once, but that was our fault, as my husband had set it up without checking the thermos, which still had coffee in it.  It was so much easier to clean up that mess, because it only went on the counter, not all inside the coffee maker. I've read of complaints about the 'tabs' on the basket breaking off, but we did not have that issue.  The components are sturdy.  Clean design.  Very happy with the quality of the coffee (we use Kirkland/Costco brand, which is roasted by Starbucks).  The thermos keeps the coffee hot for quite a while, longer if you pre-heat the thermos with hot water.

3534,Technivorm Moccamaster,"September 10, 2018","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,4,"We recently purchased this model Technivorm (although not from Amazon).  As many others have noted, it makes great-tasting coffee, at the correct temperature.  The coffee stays at a good drinking temperature for about 30 minutes in the thermal carafe; after that, you'll need to zap it in the microwave (in your cup of course) for a few seconds.  However, given its high cost (and high-brow design claims), I was surprised to find two or three design flaws.  (1) The power cord exits on the left side of the machine, rather than from the back.  This might be okay if the outlet you want to use is located a few inches to the left of where you place the machine, but that is unlikely for most users.  The design should be modified so the electrical cord exists from the REAR of the machine, like nearly every other electric appliance made.  As designed, you will have a lot of visible cord on your kitchen counter.  (2) The 'manual drip stop' feature on the filter housing is absolutely useless.  It isn't really a drip stop feature at all, because the coffee will just keep dripping out even after the switch is placed in the 'stop' position.  Even the owner's manual states that the feature is only for 'removing the filter' -- whatever that is supposed to mean.  If you may ever want to have a drip stop feature, spend the extra $10 and buy the model that comes with the 'auto drip stop' feature (although I haven't used that model and can't say whether its drip stop function actually works). The final small issue is that while the machine brew a pot of coffee in five or six minutes, it continues to drip from the filter into the pot for at least another five or six minutes.  Since there is no working drip stop, your choices are: (1) remove the pot anyway, pour yourself a cup, then clean up the spillage on the counter; or (2) remove the entire filter holder and hold it over the sink (or garbage can) while pouring your cup of coffee. Overall, a good machine that makes great tasting coffee.  But, for over $300, it shouldn't have any flaws.","Makes great coffee, but has a few design flaws",Amazon,0

The Mocha Master was recommended to me by a friend.  Its a relatively expensive pot compared to others, but I wanted the best!  I've spent far more on high end espresso machines in the past and have realized I just really like a great cup of black coffee.  When I first opened the box I was surprised at how cheaply made the plastic parts are.  The cone filter and plastic 'stand' where it sits are as flimsy as a mr. coffee type pot.  The overall machine and pot are sturdy and well made.  The water heats up quickly to the perfect temperature.  I used the cone filter first and it was ok but a pain to clean, so i switched to the paper filters (the ones made by the same brand).  The water kept overflowing and coffee would get everywhere.  So i checked the bean grind for course or fine and I realized it was too fine, so I changed it.  Better but still getting stuck from time to time.  Then I started using less coffee (thinking maybe I put too much in)..a little better but still not great.  The whole process of making coffee in the morning has become such a pain and this machine is so temperamental, I just started using my old french press again.  This morning I decided to make a pot of coffee in this machine because we have 3 of us getting up at the same time for coffee...same thing- overflowing grounds which made a mess.  Again.  I've tried to love this unit but it just really sucks.  I was with the girl who told me how great it was this weekend and I said 'hey remember how you told me how great the Mocha master was?  I keep having issues, do you still love yours?'  She replied, 'oh no, actually we got rid of it last year.  at first we liked it but it was such a pain to use, we just bought a really high end espresso machine that makes the best coffee' So, back to the drawing board again.  The only reason I wrote this review is to let people know that its an expensive pot for the quality you get.

After I got the dreaded death error code I was in the market for a new machine.  Although the machine did last 7 years and over 9K cups of coffee, I was loathe to spend over $1000 on a coffee machine again.  I decided to get the best reviewed of the drip coffee makers.  It took me a little while to get used to a different cup of coffee but after a month I can now say this coffee maker makes a very good cup of coffee, not as good as I have ever had, but maybe in line with the best I have had at home.  I do not get any bitterness from the coffee I brew with this pot.  There are a couple of drawbacks though.  It looks cool but it is plastic so it feels about as sturdy as other coffee makers costing 1/10th as much.  I opted for the thermal carafe and the lip has no indentation at all, causing coffee to pour widely out of the mouth and more often than not onto the counter.  Lastly, in reading the instructions I found the company to be a little too arrogant.  Essentially they say if the ratio of water to coffee they give you is not to your liking, change your taste buds, not the ratio, because the ratio is perfect.  I have changed the ratio to my liking and thus far the machine has not exploded and the earth still spins, although men in suits and sunglasses may show up on my doorstep to remove said machine after this is published.  Of, and the cost.  Yes, it's expensive, but if you are replacing a Starbucks or even Keurig habit, it will pay for itself in a few months.","Very good coffee machine, but not perfect",Amazon,3

Two issues -- 1) They market the brew-thru lid as also a pour through lid. It seems like it would function this way if it actually stayed on. Right out of the box, it would not screw tight, but instead just kept spinning. I didn't want to spin too much and mess up the threading so i just spun it as tight as it would go and gave it a shot. When I went to pour it, the lid came off and spilled the water (was just testing without coffee). So now I have to either not use the brew-thru lid, or switch it to the stopper lid after brewing every time. 2) The product is marketed as having an Auto-Off. Even for the thermal carafe model that I have, on the box there is a label saying 'Auto-Off' next to the label that says '5 year guarantee'. However, since this model has no hot plate, the auto-off that they're referring to is a little different than the time-based off feature for the hot plate. What they're referring to is the heating element turning off when the water reservoir is empty. The problem is, there's no indication of whether or not the heating element is on or off. If I turn the power switch on, the light on the switch turns on. Any water in the reservoir immediately starts heating up and pushing it out (so make sure you're ready before you switch it on). That's all fine, but when the reservoir is empty, the heating element supposedly turns off.... how do I know that it's off? How do I know it's not sitting there heating nothing, wasting energy, creating a fire hazard. If you put more water into the reservoir, it quickly heats it again, which makes me wonder if the heating element was ever off. The light on the power switch never turns off until you turn the switch itself off. I plan to turn off the switch when it's done brewing, but what happens when I forget and go to work? After researching around, I've read that the heating element is supposed to know when the water reservoir is empty through the use of the float switch (the white thing underneath the metal plate with slits in the reservoir). My problem is I have no idea if it's working correctly and turning the heating element off, or if the heating element just stays on and wastes energy or creates a fire hazard after enough time. Also, the float becomes level when there's water in the reservoir, which makes sense, but when the reservoir is empty (still not fully empty, which is also kind of annoying for keeping it clean), the left half of the float stays at the top and the right half dips down (as opposed to the whole float lowering down, which I would have expected). No way for me to know if that's how it's supposed to be, or if the left side is stuck and keeping the heating element on.",Some issues...,Amazon,2

However, I'm still disappointed and cannot recommend this coffee maker at this price point (however, it would be a great $100 coffee maker...) I recommend completely ignoring the ridiculous amount of grounds recommended in the manual and start with your usual measure for the water volume you use, and then experiment from there. I made side-by-side pots with identical ingredient measurements with this pot and my little Mr. Coffee (noted below).  Based on what I spent, I really wanted to taste a difference, but could not.  Very disappointed, but also learned I was actually getting the best possible results out of the setup I've used for so long. In my opinion, a $300+ coffee pot should dispense ambrosia with little or no effort.  However, for partial pots the thermal carafe version requires preheating the carafe with hot water to prevent excessively cooling the coffee as it's dispensed from the filter. Failure to do this and then pouring your fresh brew into a standard ceramic mug means the coffee arrives tepid after being cooled by both the carafe and the mug.  It's simply extra steps to compensate for what a glass carafe on a burner does for you. You can have the best possible coffee for a $10 investment in a standard filter cone, quality paper coffee filters (try Melita bamboo), and filtered, manually boiled water poured over the grounds at about 200ºF.  A fancier cone version is found in the Chemex carafe, but it's exactly the same basic process. Anything more is merely paying for convenience or status. I've bought an expensive lesson to learn this. Original post - I purchased this particular make and model specifically because it was rated #1 by Cook's Illustrated a few years back and because of the favorable Amazon reviews.  I wanted a superior cup of coffee and was willing to pay for it, but so far, it hasn't lived up to the hype. Initial impression is that it's very well constructed, although much bigger than most coffee makers; the thing stands about 16' high. The sealed vacuum carafe is a good idea for short term storage (< 1 hour in my estimate) to keep the coffee fresh and hot.  Longer than that and it begins to cool too much.  The pour-while-closed stopper is a neat idea and works fairly well. The instructions call for a coarse grind, but the amount of coffee suggested for the basket is over DOUBLE the amount I use to brew the same amount in my little Mr. Coffee machine (model DR5).  I like a strong, robust brew (not burned or bitter) and I use a gram weight scale to measure for consistency.  Generally speaking, I expect the bottom of the cup to disappear within the first inch while filling.  For 20 oz of brew in the Mr. Coffee machine I use 15 grams (roughly ¼ cup) of a medium coarse grind.  The Technivorm instructions call for 34.5 grams to brew the same 20 oz.  Nevertheless, for my first pots I followed the instructions to the letter with the manual drain set in the mid-position for a half pot according to the instructions and the full 34.5 grams in the basket... and was sorely disappointed with the weak and bitter results. Examining the grounds, it was immediately obvious that the hot water spray into the basket was concentrated in the center of the cone, which allowed the water to drill a hole directly through the grounds to the bottom and bypass most of the contents.  Ideally, the water should be distributed over a wide enough area and the filter cone should drain slowly (I had the drain valve positioned correctly) enough to prevent this basic error and ensure even extraction from ALL the grounds.  My $30 Mr. Coffee does that much.  Even a $10 filter cone over a mug and water manually boiled (which I use while traveling) does a much better job. I'll do some tinkering with the grind size and amount to try and produce a superior brew, but if things don't shape up quickly it's headed back.",First Impression: Disappointment,Amazon,0

You might even notice flavors you never tasted before. It’s not fancy, and you’Il probably end up experimenting a bit with things like grinder coarseness and coffee-to-water ratios. It’s also not cheap, but there are sociological, political and environmental reasons for that. I just hope it holds up as well as they claim. A few things that might need clarification: 1. Although the power button and light stay on, the heating element shuts off automatically when brewing is complete. People complaining about that probably don’t understand how it operates. 2. The thermal carafe works extremely well, but keep in mind cool air gets sucked into the carafe and replaces the hot liquid as you pour the coffee out. If you brew a pot and leave it full, it stays hot for a few hours. If the outside of the carafe gets hot, it’s defective and should be replaced under warranty. 3. On mine, the “travel” lid doesn’t thread very well into the carafe, and it requires some serious tightening to avoid leaking. I won’t be traveling with a pot of coffee, so it’s just a minor annoyance. The brewing lid with the long tube works fine, and you can pour through it without loosening it. It also keeps the coffee hot long enough if you drink at a normal pace. 4. There are too many definitions of a cup of coffee, none of which are 8 ounces oddly. This thing makes 1.25 liters, or about 42 ounces. You can do the math for your own mugs. Luckily, it only takes about 6 minutes to brew a pot. I originally tried to save money with a Warehouse Deal, but it was poorly repackaged and arrived damaged (as in totally unusable). Note that the factory packaging doesn’t prevent the carafe from hitting/breaking the plastic filter basket arm when dropped upside down. I ultimately gave up on Amazon and bought a refurbished unit from Tecnivorm. It still took three or four tries to get it right. Bottom line: I’m happy so far, even though I now have two manually operated appliances that replaced a 10-yr old Capresso auto grind & brew machine (the last of the good design).

Simple system. Simple is good. My last machine had a mini computer inside. We opted for the thermal carafe, as we enjoy taking the pot with us for coffee outdoors in season. So far, well pleased.

The Problem is they changed the carafe top. It used to have a black plastic seal on top of the carafe that the plug screwed into and now it does not. This is a problem because the 'new' design allows the plug on top to fall out when the carafe gets hot and you end up pouring coffee all over the place. This did not occur with the prior thermal carafe that had the black plastic seal.  Obviously, they tried to save a few bucks by removing the black seal and now have a defective carafe. I would only buy this product if you can get the prior generation thermal carafe with the black plastic seal on top.  I contacted Technivorm and started getting a run around from customer service about replacing the carafe because I did not have a receipt despite ordering from Amazon.  I ended up giving the coffee maker the 'office space' faxmachine treatment.",New generation thermal carafe is terrible.,Amazon,2

Pricey, but it turns out you get what you pay for!! Not pricey when I count how many Cuisinart coffee machines I've gone through. Things that caught my attention were that it was made somewhere besides China, by people who take pride in what they do.  It is very simple in it's overall mechanics.  Simple yet precise.  It doesn't simply turn water brown. The right temperature brings out the right flavor.  It's not rocket science but there is a science to it.  I've had many coffee makers over the years and consider myself a bit of a coffee snob.  Not as crazy as some but enough to buy great beans and grind my own daily.  This doesn't have all the bells and whistles that many people feel are necessary, like a timer turning on the machine before you wake up.  That's fine because I didn't use that anyway. What it does do is make fantastic coffee!!  I considered a taste test of my own, but it was unnecessary.  After one sip of coffee from the first pot, I knew instantly it was better.  Same beans, but wow!!  The only down side I see is drinking more coffee, and possibly being a bit more picky in what I'll tolerate.  Oh, and it looks cool brewing too.  The little bubbling up of the water is fun to watch. If you are on the fence I'd encourage you to go for it.  With Amazon's easy returns you have nothing to lose.  I'm very glad I saved a bit longer and finally splurged on this machine.  From the reviews about how long these last (one person has had theirs for 20+ years!!)

For years we have been looking for a coffee maker that could heat and distribute the water sufficiently to produce a cup of coffee as superior as using the manual Melitta cone drip system my German grandmother used on a daily basis (i.e. pouring boiling hot water over coffee grounds from a tea kettle into a porcelain Melitta cone filter holder).  As yet, no other coffee maker we purchased could closely match that wonderful aromatic and bitter-free cup of coffee - until now!  We took a chance on this maker after having read a review by the folks on PBS's show 'America's Test Kitchen.'  We were a little apprehensive at first, but after reading many additional reviews we took the plunge and purchased this Thermo-carafe model.  The plunge paid off, and we are thrilled to finally have found the 'holy grail' of perfect coffee-makers.  Now, a quick important note to all of those reviewers who griped about the Thermo-carafe not keeping the coffee as warm...  There is a very simple solution to this issue.  Before making your coffee, simply pour boiling water into the empty carafe to preheat it and take the interior chill off (we have an electric kettle that boils water very quickly).  When you're ready to make the coffee, simply empty the carafe and it will remain hot as the coffee maker refills it with fresh hot coffee.  Since we polish all the cups it makes off within a couple of hours, it keeps the coffee hot until we empty it.  The price is higher than typical coffee makers, but if you're a slave to awesome coffee (obviously using quality beans), this is well worth the cost!",Makes an awesome cup of coffee like my German Grandmother used to make!,Amazon,0

Parts disassemble for easy cleaning--especially the chromed hot water tube that goes to the filter and coffee.  The carafe keeps coffee piping hot, but screwing in the cover lid or the channeled brewing cover occasionally is tricky.  The ONE DESIGN FLAW is the lip of the carafe. When pouring out the last half-a-cup of the coffee from the carafe the liquid somehow transitions from a steady stream to a widened splatter sending coffee outside all but the largest coffee mug. Just a simple crimp in the stainless rim/lip of the carafe would almost certainly guide that last pour efficiently into the lucky coffee mug. Coffee remains hot in the carafe for hours. The flow rate selector that holds the filter is great if a half a pot is to be brewed and keeps the coffee stronger by slowing the drip rate. Also, if the pot is to be removed while coffee is still dripping you can stop the flow until the pot is replaced.

I agree with many of the comments and quirks of this machine, but my wife and I love the hot coffee and grind our beans every morning and are very happy with the cuppa.  That said we have found out some things about the machine. It will stop working at some point, not if.  When the water hardens on the filament in the hot water reservoir it will stop by design for fire issues I guess.  The way to fix this is to take the top off, take off the metal bar and turn the machine upside down over the sink and empty out the water inside the reservoir.  If you don't do this the cleaning solution will sit on top of the water in the reservoir. We fill it up with white vinegar and let it sit for an hour or so.  We have used some expensive cleaners but find white vinegar works best, we buy a gallon of it at Costco. At some point after the white vinegar sits in the machine it will start to heat again.  Once it starts to heat the vinegar, during the day when we walk by the machine we will heat up the white vinegar and let it pump out a little bit of hot vinegar, then pull the carafe away.  We leave the machine turned on.  That evening we will run the tank of white vinegar through the machine.  The small amount of vinegar will sit in the reservoir all night.  In the morning we pour the white vinegar that is cool in the carafe back into the machine and run it through again.  We then run three courses of clean water through the machine and swab out the interior of the water holder.  We find this keeps the machine working and heating the water consistently. We use only water from a Britta water purifier and put the water in each night so it is room temperature by the morning.  Don't know if that helps.  But definitely use water with minerals removed to avoid cleaning outlined above and to keep the machine pumping.  We clean our machine about every six months using the above method. Our machine is now about ten years old and still pumping away.

I want to review it here as well. The Moccamaster is amazing. There is a significant taste difference between this coffee maker and my previous inexpensive maker. The design is simple: the brewer heats water between 195 and 205 degrees. Rather than use a single point of water application, the Moccamaster distributes hot water across the entire surface of the coffee grounds instead of a single point in the center of the grounds. The brewing time tends to be slower than less expensive makers. You can adjust the amount of time by adjusting the aperture at the bottom of the grounds funnel: the small opening exposes grounds to hot water for a longer period of time; the larger hole brews more rapidly but potentially with a lower quality brew. I've tried both and both are delicious. The unit is easy to clean. It does not allow you to auto-brew at a specific time. This is intentional because coffee is better if it is ground immediately prior to brewing. My only complaint about this maker is the build quality. While the brewer base is constructed solidly, the plastic components are kind of janky. The arm through which hot water is distributed is well built as a component but the connection to the hot water output could have been designed more solidly. The control for adjusting the aperture size at the bottom of the filter cup is difficult to set at the middle value because of the plastic components.

Stiff price in contrast to the prices for other coffee makers, until you taste the difference.  Then it's worth the investment every morning!

I debated whether to go with the usual $30-50 standard Mr Coffee, but went for the $310 Moccamaster. I really like it!

I did a lot of reading, reviews etc and finally decided to spend the money on the Moccamaster. The following is anecdotal based on my own experience with my Moccamaster after six month use. First thing to note, the build quality is not what is described. The main unit itself is decent, but the threads of the lid of the carafe do not match the carafe well and it's often a struggle to properly close it. The carafe does not hold the heat for very long. If you like hot coffee, buy something else. I wish I had went with a coffee make with a heater under a glass carafe. My next issue is that during each brew the coffee spills backwards as it flows from the filter into the carafe. It runs along the plastic, backwards towards the aluminum body and pools down onto the base of the unit and the counter. So I always have a mess to clean for each brew. All right, so what's good about it? Well, it does make brew a pretty nice cup of coffee (although I wish it was just a little hotter).",Doesn't live up to the hype,Amazon,12

Simple, efficient, easy to use and clean. Makes an excellent cup of coffee. Absolutely no complaints. The carafe, however, is a complete and total failure. It looks good, it's well made. But whoever came up with the terrible 'pour in any direction' spout on top needs to be clubbed over the head with one of these pieces of junk. Sure, you can pour in any direction. Any direction except into what you're trying to pour into. I've been using this daily for several months now. At first, I thought it was just a technique issue. Months of practice and I still spill coffee almost every single day. If you're pouring into a wide-mouth mug, you shouldn't have any issues. I fill a travel mug, then put the rest in a good old Stanley drink thermos. The kind with the roughly 2' mouth. Good luck! I now keep a roll of paper towels next to the coffee pot so I can wipe down the inevitable spills every morning. I would love to blame myself for being too clumsy to pour a cup of coffee, but I'm simply not a clumsy person. The one star the carafe earns to keep it from reaching negative is that the pour 'spout' design is extremely good about not letting drips of coffee run down the side of the pot.

Using the same beans the first thing one notices is the coffee is 'brighter' as it is now brewed at a proper temperature.  There are many reviews and suggestions online about how to use this machine to its fullest and I suggest playing around with a few methods until you find the one that works best for your palate.  There are some really hard core users of this machine and it has been fun reading different techniques people use. The plastics on the machine are good quality and clean up nicely.  I bought some nice new brush's just to use with this machine, especially a long skinny one for the brewing tube. The ergonomics of the machine are OK.  I don't agree with many of the complaints regarding pouring and the design of the lid.  One quickly finds out how it all works.  If you pour to hard the spout spill some from the sides.  This is not hard science to learn.  This machine is not like any other so before purchasing I'd search about on the internet and find a few reviews and comparisons. While this machine will brew 8 cups in 6 minutes it is not a machine I'd recommend for those in a rush out the door in the morning.

So, with apologies to Clint Eastwood... THE GOOD 1) It makes exceptionally good coffee. Every time (every time something doesn't go wrong...see 'THE BAD' below). We're coffee snobs so we only by top-shelf, whole-bean coffee and grind it ourselves just before use. The difference in taste from our previous coffee maker, even with identical brands of coffee, is quite noticeable--I think it has something to do with the brew process. It can brew an entire pot in about three minutes--which can be a mixed blessing (again, see 'THE BAD' below).. 2) No moving parts, except for a little activator button on the bottom, hence less to break down. 3) Coffee is always at the precise correct temperature when it is freshly brewed, and the thermal carafe' keeps it that way for several hours. THE BAD 1) It's not exceptionally robust, build-wise. Probably not major as there are as mentioned earlier no moving parts. But the plastic parts can break. We've had the round plastic plate that fits over the brew basket break, and the basket itself develop a crack. In fairness we would always clean these parts by running them through the dishwasher and they may not be designed for that. In any case, we now wash them by hand. 2) Things have to be lined up PRECISELY for it to work. For example, the carafe', during the brewing process, sits on a small plastic plate that itself fits into a little socket on the underside of the unit. If the plate does not fit precisely into the socket (and it's a little difficult at first to accurately gauge that, the whole unit can set at a slight tilt. You wouldn't think that would make a difference, but it does. It took us a couple of major spills to learn that. Also you have to make sure that, when brewing, the carafe is pushed snugly up against the brewing unit, which opens a valve underneath the brew basket and simultaneously activates the brewer by depressing the little white button on the bottom. The problem is that if not pushed snugly, the button activates the unit but the valve under the brew basket opens only partially. The unit doesn't know that; it goes ahead and brews away full-speed, resulting in the basket overflowing as more water is going in than can get out. 3) Putting too much coffee into the brew basket (we always use paper filters although you can also use a copper sieve which comes with the unit) can also cause spills. We use six moderately-heaped tablespoons of whole-bean coffee, which is then ground. Anything substantially more seems to be hard for the unit to handle as the water (and ground coffee) rises above the level of the filter and the ground coffee that overflows plugs the valve. I don't think that would be the case with the copper sieve, but we don't use that too much and anyway six tablespoons yields a powerful brew even through the paper filter. THE UGLY 1) It is advertised as an eight-cup coffee maker, but remember that it is made in The Netherlands and one European cup equals maybe half of one of ours. 2) Replacement parts are EXPENSIVE. I just replaced the brew basket through Amazon (3rd party seller) and paid something like $28 for it. Probably not excessive when considering the entire unit costs about $300.00, but I've bought whole coffeemakers for less. 3) Hard to clean. When it floods over the ground coffee seems to get lodged in every nook and cranny on the way down, and there are lots of nooks and crannies. As the picture shows, it is built with far more angles than curves. I use a gentle spray from the dish sprayer to clean it and that seems to work pretty well, but the unit does not come apart for cleaning so whenever I do that I take great pains that no water gets anywhere near the brewer bottom or switch. BOTTOM LINE It makes wonderful coffee, which is really the most important thing. You will have some problems at first as the thing definitely is persnickety, but once you get the hang of it, and taste the results, you'll never want to go back to a lesser coffee maker again. I know I won't.",Great but Finicky,Amazon,1

The blogs turned out to be pure marketing and nothing more. This makes the same cup of coffee as any other drip machine that uses 'correct-ish' temp water. Including the $79 Bunn this maker replaced. The stainless steel from the carafe and the drip maker don't match. The plastic is VERY cheap looking. Plastic touches hot water the second it's dribbled out of the head and into the everyday filter holder. There are ZERO functions or features. Even $15 coffee makers have more options and many of those cheap machines - make the SAME tasting cup of coffee. The water is heated as it passes the heat exchange and that is nice (instant hot, fast brew), however the water doesn't 'sit' with the grind for any time and just like every other cheapo machine - it just passes through the paper #4 filter that sits in the plastic housing. Also it doesn't seem to regulate the water temp coming out. If you add hot water - your water is to hot, if you add super cold water - it's not hot enough. I hope your house is calibrated to give this machine the perfect temp water it needs, to heat it to the right temp!  The carafe is nice enough - just like any other double walled stainless steel carafe or thermos, it keeps coffee hot for about 2 hours. It does however splatter the coffee a bit when you pour - due to the way the lid is made. Maybe the extra $250 you spend on this is for the hand assembly of it? It's not a real 'feature' however. It's just cheap parts assembled by hand like 90% of most other factory built items. For $300+ a pop, the company should have been able to match the stainless steel and buy some robots - to lower production cost and get this machine into the price point it should be at - $49 The worst part (besides the horrid value) is that is a PITA to use. There are to many little parts to disassemble and hand clean before/after use every morning. Water tank lid, filter housing lid, filter housing, carafe funnel, a carafe (with a tiny opening - to small for normal scrub brushes) and a carafe lid! Every morning. It gets old fast! I also was unimpressed by the looks. My wife and I both found it to be large and cheap looking. We live near Seattle, we drink a ton of coffee, we use a burr grinder on fresh coffee and we are definitely considered the coffee snobs of our friends (after all, we gave this $300 machine a shot right!?). The best coffee we have had came from a $20 french press, the next came from a now discontinued infusion vacuum coffee maker. This Moccamaster (why not CoffeeMaster?

I even got a $100 Cuisinart as a wedding gift and it only lasted 6 months. This brewer is a revelation! I then read The Art and Craft of Coffee: An Enthusiast's Guide to Selecting, Roasting, and Brewing Exquisite Coffee on my kindle fire and learned about excellent coffee. Mr. Coffee just won't cut it. Not even close. It's not hot enough and will not extract coffee correctly. To make excellent coffee, you need an excellent brewer. Right temperature, right extraction. You also need excellent coffee and a grinder and scale. I used this brewer with the last of my Starbuck's that had been ground weeks before. WOW what a difference already. Now I buy locally roasted fresh beans, use within a week or two, grind at home just before brewing, and this brewer is wonderful! Highly recommend read The Art and Craft of Coffee: An Enthusiast's Guide to Selecting, Roasting, and Brewing Exquisite Coffee and learn about excellent coffee.

I read tons of reviews and watched lots of video how-tos on YouTube. It is attractive and seems well made, but after using it daily for a couple of months, I never really got what I consider to be the 'perfect' cup. I realize that's a subjective thing, however. Granted, I like very strong coffee. I've been using a vintage percolator or French Press for years to brew my coffee because I hate when it's weak. I haven't used a drip machine in years so perhaps my taste buds are just no longer used to the less stout brew that drip machines produce.  I tried several methods of brewing to get a stronger flavor, but more often than not, the stronger brews tasted sour to me. I grind fresh daily with a burr grinder and I use really good coffee and filtered water, but I still prefer the taste of French Press or percolator above all other brew methods. I was going to send this back considering that it's a $300+ dollar machine, but I missed the return window and may try selling it as a second hand item instead.

The verdict: very consistent, excellent brewing, easy to use and clean and very, very hot. Two minor gripes. There's a fill line on the water reservoir, but none on the steel carafe. So you either deliberately overfill the carafe when you fill the reservoir or you eventually get good at guessing how much water to pour into the carafe when you fill the reservoir. Of course you can use a large measuring cup but that seems unnecessarily complicated for such a simple problem. Not a big deal, but I don't like pouring out excess water. Second, the carafe sits on a plastic plate that is loosely attached to the brewer. It's easy to attach, but it also falls off if you lift up the brewer. That too is annoying. overall, worth it.

It brings out the flavor of the coffee.  Medium grind works well. I have used both cheap and expensive brands of coffee, and all have worked well.  It suggests using bottled water to avoid the mineral deposits from building up in the machine, and causing problems with brewing.;  I have happily adhered to that.  I suspect a water filter pitcher would work fine as well. It also recommends that the water be cold going into the brewer, for the perfect saturation time.  I have had it for a few years without any problems.  Because of the precision and 3 required elements to brew a good coffee (saturation time, aeration of the water, temperature of water when brewing), you cannot set it ahead the night before.  To use, you just put in the grinds and the water, and hit the button to on.  It only takes a few more minutes to brew the coffee than standard makers, and those couple minutes are well worth your time, believe me!

Also, I haven't had the machine very long and have made only about 10 pots with it, many of them purely to experiment with grind coarseness and drip-stop setting when making smaller amounts of coffee. The part that appears to be defective is the brew-through carafe lid. Mine just drops into the opening in the carafe with the threads never making contact. After brewing is complete, the heat has caused the lid to expand to the point that it's a light friction fit, so it won't drop out when pouring. However, the lid does become loose again as the liquid volume in the carafe declines, and it can fall out when pouring the last cup. A new lid has been sent to me, and I'll update this review accordingly. Some here claim to not like the idea of brewing with one lid, then needing to replace that lid with the 'travel stopper' (Technivorm's description). In fact, the Brew-Through lid is designed to be left in place and pours very nicely. The stopper is only necessary if one plans to carry the carafe around in a way that could slosh coffee out. I do agree though, the stopper will keep the contents hotter longer than the brew-through lid. However, because brewed coffee tastes poor more than 30 minutes after brewing, those planning to drink the carafe's contents over a period of several hours should probably just stick with a less expensive machine, because they'll never notice the difference in coffee quality after the first 30 minutes. To address complaints -  The carafe plate - many complaints here that the plate continually becomes disengaged from the machine. The plate has 3 tabs, which if engaged correctly, will prevent the plate from coming loose when sliding the machine on a counter top. I've even lifted my machine to move it and not had the plate come loose.  No programming - Technivorm's website (tinyurl.com/hq5z6kf) has a fairly comprehensive list of FAQs in which they explain that there's no ability to program, because coffee and water left in the machine overnight for brewing in the morning will not give the best flavor. They also explain why the thermal carafe model has no timer or hot plate (the glass carafe model does), and that the brewing process shuts off when the water reservoir is empty or if the carafe isn't in place. Seriously folks - I'd think a person would want to do a little homework before shelling out $300 for a coffee maker and then complaining that it doesn't have the 'features' of their $29.95 Mr. Coffee machine, DeLonghi, Black & Decker, etc.   Too many parts -  Unlike most other coffee machines, replacement parts are available on the manufacturer's website, along with tech support. I once broke the plastic carafe lid on a $90 DeLonghi machine and had to purchase a complete new carafe...at 2/3 the price of the complete machine. I tossed the machine instead.   Most other complaints I see here are addressed on Technivorm's website, so a person can decide whether this might be for them or not before purchase, and avoid aggravation. Coffee 'quality.'   I began using auto-drip coffee machines in 1975, starting with the first one I saw available (Mr. Coffee original), but I didn't start grinding beans till about 20 years ago, and that was with a cheap, blade-type grinder, which also serves as an herb chopper. And that's what a blade-type really is... a chopper. It whacks all the coffee repeatedly, warming it and causing it to lose flavor. After purchasing a Capresso burr grinder, the very same coffee tasted completely different in my old DeLonghi machine. Much more robust and flavorful. So when the DeLonghi went belly up, I figured I'd get this fancy brewer, made by little Dutch elves and guaranteed 5 years. A video review from America's Test Kitchen and another from Cnet praise this KBT 741 highly, going so far as to say it's the only one in their tests that met some prestigious European 'golden cup' standard for coffee quality. But what one person considers high quality, another person might consider sludge. If you like the coffee served at Denny's or Waffle House, this machine might not be for you. However, if you like coffee served at Starbucks, the KBT 741 is right up your alley.   But be aware, the coarseness or fineness of the grind will have a very noticeable effect on the body and flavor, so experimentation will be necessary to get the flavor you like. And grinding with a burr will drastically alter (for the better) the flavor of whatever coffee you've been grinding with a blade-type chopper, mainly because the grounds will be uniform size and not heated during grinding. Cup size - How many ounces in a cup? Mr. Coffee set the 5-ounce standard here in the US with their first machine, even supplying a pouring decanter marked in 5-ounce cups, and most coffee machines sold here today still use the 5-ounce measure. But not so in Europe, where 4 ounces is the standard, and that's what this Moccamaster uses - 4-ounces per cup. So this 10-cup coffee maker holds 40 ounces, which is actually 8 standard 5-ounce cups. Confused? You should be. To make it even more confusing, Technivorm recommends using the Golden Cup standard of the SCAA of 2 tablespoons of ground coffee for every 6oz of water. This means you need 14 level tablespoons of ground coffee for a 40-ounce pot...which is about twice the amount you're likely using now for 40 ounces of water in your present machine. I tried using only 12 tablespoons one time, but the coffee tasted like dish water, so use the recommended amount. Too strong or bitter? Add hot water to your cup (Technivorm's recommendation). Or try grinding more coarsely, but don't use less coffee. Too weak? Technivorm recommend changing coffee brand or using a darker roast, but I've found that grinding more finely deepens the flavor. Don't increase the amount of coffee though, because the taste will become bitter. Bottom Line -   This machine does brew excellent tasting coffee, provided your tastes run toward full-bodied coffee. But, getting the best results involves precise grinding and measuring along with a willingness to experiment. Frankly, I found that the biggest improvement in our coffee flavor resulted from switching to a burr grinder, with the Moccamaster providing only a marginal improvement in flavor, though it has eliminated bitterness. Just for comparison purposes, we've been experimenting with our usual blends - Costco House Blend roasted by Starbucks and Starbucks French Roast. I'll try the usual high-end suspects such as Peets, Gevalia, etc. before making final conclusions. For now, the jury is still out. I think I may be a victim of confirmation bias, thinking that for $300, this machine MUST be capable of making better tasting coffee than my old DeLonghi, if only I can stumble onto the correct brand/roast/grind.

While it makes a decent cup of coffee, the design has so many problems I'd not recommend it. First, while it does brew at the recommended temperature (checked with Thermapen), the coffee is almost immediately cooler than ideal.  The insulated carafe does hold some heat, but even when preheated per the instructions it is just lukewarm after maybe 30 minutes. The design issues, in no particular order: 1)  The boiler/water pump? does not fully cycle all the water, After finishing the brew cycle there's over a cup of water left still in the works.  I'd rather not be using water that has been sitting out a day, nor is unplugging the machine to take it to the sink to empty a happy chore. 2)  The use of two different 'lids' for the carafe adds complexity to no apparent advantage.  To brew you use the one, but to keep any of the lukewarmth in you have to switch to the other stopper.  With the other stopper installed the carafe won't fit back in the machine because of the stopper's height.  And, both lids produced weak, splashing pours. 3)  The design of the temporary shutoff is weak - since it is manual (unlike the automatic design of my older Braun) you could shut it while brewing and overflow the works. 4)  The carafe is poorly designed with a lip or trap inside the top circumference, requiring shaking to get the last of coffee out and resulting in incomplete draining when set upside down to dry. 5)  The Technivorm's Rube Goldberg design has too many separate pieces to keep track of.  Besides the double lids already mentioned, the 'pad' that sits under the carafe when brewing isn't a part of the machine but a plastic sheet that separates from the rest of the machine everytime you move it.  There's also a separate lid for the water reservoir (the Braun for example is hinged in place), a separate grounds container plus its lid (the Braun doesn't require a lid and the basket is hinged but removeable). 6)  The height of this machine makes it impossible to operate under kitchen cabinets set at standard height above the counter top.  So to use it you need to pull it out, at which point the base plate separates, etc. Not recommended",Flawed and Expensive,Amazon,4

Good coffee, but bottom line is it's not worth the money--you can make great coffee for less and the machine itself feels very cheap. It lives up to its promises to make great coffee because it consistently sprays 205-degree water over your grounds. I also used to be able to do that with my $40 French press and an electric kettle. For $300, it's simply not worth it. Meanwhile, I wanted to tear out my hair over the way the bottom tray kept coming out (we used duct tape--duct tape!--to hold it in place), the cheap feeling plastic lids on top ended up just sort of staying on the countertop, and by the way it got tough to clean after a while (simplicity of cleaning is the whole justification they give for the flimsiness of parts!). All this for a coffee that really isn't better than other brewing methods. I think people convince themselves to like this machine out of a sense of pretentiousness (Bunn and Bonavita make good temperature-controlling models, but it's not a Moccamaster, by God).

Maybe if you find a machine that reaches 198° to 204° quickly and finishes brewing in 7 to 8 minutes.  The Technivorm does exactly that but the other essential components are finding a local roaster and grinding it fresh before brewing.

3793,Technivorm Moccamaster,"April 23, 2016","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,5,"I purchased this coffee maker a couple months ago to replace a Black and Decker we used for 25 years. Hemmed and hawed about replacing the BD for a long time as it was much loved. When we decided it was time, we first tried the Bonavita. That's a great coffee maker by all accounts, but the the results weren't the best. In talking to the folks at Bonavita, we found that the water comes out a bit hot for the dark roasts we like, so it went back. Not a slam on that machine at all. I know many people like it very much. So after looking at the options again, we bought the Technivorm. It is an outstanding machine. Somewhere in the marketing literature, you'll read the claim 'nothing but the taste of coffee,' or some such. This is absolutely true. But there's something else. Coffee out of this machine has the aromatic blossom of the grind it brews from. Stop and think of that. Maybe it's just me, but I have always been more impressed with the aroma of fresh grind than the taste of the coffee. It's as if the beans make promises they can't keep.  Some tinkering is involved to achieve this effect (see YouTube), but once you get it right, it's repeatable and makes the Moccamaster worth every penny. It makes the best coffee I have ever had. No question. Some of the things I remember from reading Amazon Reviews of the Moccamaster are as follows: The water reservoir is definitely plastic and not glass. Not a problem though, as I have never tasted it in the coffee. The material is quite thick and might seem like glass, but it's not.  On that note, some folks complained that the machine's build overall is a bit flimsy, and I can see where they are coming from. Apart from the water res, it is is a bit lighter than you might expect, looking at the photos. It seems industrial and should have more heft. However, after two months of use, this isn't an issue in our experience. All materials are very good quality, and the design is plenty robust for longevity in daily home use, lids and small parts included. I wouldn't put it to work in a restaurant, but that's not what it was designed for. Last thing I can remember from Amazon Comments that might be interesting is about the power switch lacking an auto-off.  There are two external power controls. One is a manual On/Off rocker switch, and the other is a failsafe button on the bottom right of the machine that stops the brew when the carafe is removed. The owner's guide has language about consumer responsibility and the preservation of precious natural resources, in aid of guilting you to shut it off when the brew is finished. Furthermore, some folks worry about what happens with the boiler if you forget to do so. The answer is you can leave it on without risk of perdition or costly repairs. The water reservoir has a float switch inside it that senses zero water and shuts down the major components when the brew is finished, consuming nearly zero electricity. The power light stays on and probably some minor circuitry too, but the boiler shuts off.  Further, no natural wetlands are harmed in the use of this machine, nor frogs, Puck or any of his forest friends. I never use the switch, and instead stop the brew when desired by moving the carafe out of position and store the carafe similarly. You can rest easy. No auto-off isn't a problem. My opinion, just put your head down and buy it if you have the scratch. Most likely, you'll be very happy you did. Hope that helps.",Outstanding brewer.,Amazon,6

The build quality is top notch, it looks great (IMO), and with adequate user intervention, makes an excellent cup of coffee. That 'adequate user intervention' part is the kicker here... Unfortunately, the way in which the water is dispersed over the grounds means you will often have under-extracted pots of coffee. Even when I followed the Technivorm instructions to the letter (using high quality water and coffee), the resultant pots were sour and weak. Here's what happens: When the brew cycle is started, water comes out and concentrates towards the center of the basket. Midway through the brew cycle, the grounds around the outer edge are still dry. It is not until the last two cups or so of water that all of the grounds become soaked. Unfortunately, by this time, there is only about 1 minute left in the brew cycle, which is not enough time for proper extraction of the grounds near the outer edge of the basket. The result is a noticeably under-extracted brew. I have tried closing the switch part way to slow flow, but even at the partial open position, the water still drains out too quickly. The only work around to this under-extraction problem is to grind your beans much finer to help slow the water down through the basket, and to stir the grounds periodically through the brew cycle. Now, in the Moccamaster's defense, if you follow these work around tips, the resultant brew is excellent. In my humble opinion though, you shouldn't have to fiddle with a $300+ coffee machine for it to do its job properly. Why Technivorm hasn't improved the showerhead design in the 40+ years of making these machines, I have no clue, but if you want decent tasting coffee from this machine, you need to stir the grounds. This is not a set-it-and-forget-it coffee maker... For that, I suggest looking at the Bonavita BV1900 or BV1800. Both of these machines make coffee that is on-par with the Moccamaster, and the water dispersion is far superior! Come on, Technivorm... fix your stinking showerhead and I would reconsider! Until then, I can't recommend this machine.",Poor water dispersion is a deal breaker,Amazon,36

Easy to use and care for. 12-15-2016 - Update - I have now owned this coffee maker for 9 months and I am extremely disappointed.  I have cleaned it more often than recommended so that is not the problem.  Below are the things that I am not happy with: 1) I agree with other reviews that the carafe does not keep the coffee hot.  I always run 8 cups of water through the pot first to heat the carafe first but I need to heat each cup after the first cup in the microwave. 2) I need to watch the brewing because I need to shut off the pot to ensure it drips through.  If I do not, the reservoir will overflow.  I even adjusted my grind to a course grind.  My grinder is a high quality burr grinders so that is not the problem.  I even purchased pre-ground drip coffee with the same result. 3) Price - extremely pricey for a coffee maker that does not do any better than a Mr. coffee for $29.99.

Own a French press, Chemex, Hario Mizudashi, espresso machine etc. Shamefully used a keurig for years for convenience sake but once it bit the dust we knew it was time to get serious. We did  exchange the K741 for this version. Makes some outstanding coffee. We grind our beans ourselves, took a few tries to get the right grind and avoid overextraction. Between medium and coarse works well for darker roasts which we often use. Using Filtropa brand filters (which the Moccamaster comes with 3 samples of). Operation is a breeze. Fill water reservoir, fill basket with grounds, press button and bam in less than 6 minutes a delicious pot of brown yumness. I've seen some reviews claiming the carafe doesn't keep the coffee hot. Maybe if you live in an igloo. The carafe comes with two lids a brew through lid which is pretty cool, allows the coffee to mix as it brews, filling from the bottom up, and a second lid which you'd put on after brewing which can completely seal the carafe. This lid has kept coffee brewed at 7am piping hot until 1pm (6 hours) and probably beyond if the carafe wasn't emptied at that time.

It was said to be in pristine original condition with just packaging damage. That was an absolutely accurate description. The product was/is perfect. I took it out, read the quick start guide and ran three pots of various types of coffee through it to see how it worked, how they tasted and if it had any issues. This was after I ran a pot of cold water only through the coffeemaker to clean it out. First thing I noticed was that yes, this coffeemaker has a bunch of 'parts or pieces' to it. Yes, some are plastic. Yes it cost a small fortune but I'm not paying for the parts but the whole of the machine. I want good tasting coffee relatively quickly without a lot of hassle. I would like it to be well made and last a number of years and have a fairly decent warranty. It would also help if the machine had replacement parts that did not cost the price of the original machine.  So this coffeemaker hit the mark for me on all of those desired items. Was I really going to shell out over $300 for a coffeemaker? um, well... maybe, I don't know.  Ok, so I didn't do it. I waited until one showed up in Amazon Warehouse deals and took a chance. Good call. I saved over $65.00 and I feel it is absolutely worth the $200-250 price range. It is really very easy to use if you read the quick start guide or the manual first and make sure you understand what you are working with. Its not quite as intuitive as an Apple product, but close. Its simply a manual drip coffee machine. Many people forgot how they work, we are so accustomed to using the digital highly programmed ones. I grind my own beans (just purchased a new Baratza Encore and will review it next) and so the setting of a timer isn't an issue for me. I have three dogs that have to be tended to before I get any coffee anyhow. I digress. I much prefer fresh, great tasting coffee to convenience, but that's just me. Even with getting beans out, grinding them, filling the coffeemaker basket, get filtered water out of my frig, put the water in the machine and making sure the basket is set to the open position this entire process took at most 10 minutes. And the Moccamaster literally makes a full pot of coffee in under 6 minutes. I timed it. I timed it 3 times in a row and it was scary how fast and how close to 5 minutes and 30 seconds it was every time. And its HOT coffee. I did not preheat the thermal carafe and two hours later the coffee was still hot and had steam rising off it. The coffee I made was very tasty and I used both the white paper filters that came in the box with the machine and a gold filter. The taste did not change and the machine did not 'overflow' due to the use of the gold filter. I'm sure everyone's experience is different but this is the single best drip coffeemaker I have ever used or owned. And I've had many, many coffee makers over the years....  If you have the cash, this is the machine to get for the best tasting coffee and the best warranty and replacement/repair parts.",Single best coffee maker I have ever owned.,Amazon,5

You can pay $1,000 per speaker (Mr Coffee) or you can pay $10,000 per speaker (Moccamaster). Both get the job done, but much more R&D, fit and finish has been done to the $10,000 speaker to make it 'better'. The finish is automobile paint and clear coat and the drivers used are some of the top in the industry. Most people will not notice a difference. The people that can, will appreciate the difference and are willing to pay for it. In my opinion, this coffee maker is no different and every bit the same as my example. Mr Coffee doesn't have a consistent temp. The water doesn't come out the same and the materials it's made from are drastically different. As with most Euro companies, Moccamaster is concerned about the environment and human health. Something US (and China) companies could take note of. Because of this concern, Moccamaster uses PBA free plastic, which to some....would seem flimsy. To the un-educated person that doesn't know the harmful toxins released when plastic is heated...would question the durability of this PBA free plastic. My wife and I are very tuned into these types of things and appreciated the PBA free plastic. In fact, it was a selling point for us. As for the 'performance'. Once you have dialed in the amount of grinds to water, to me, it's the quality of a pour-over cup of coffee. Much better than your typical drip and not quite the awesomess of French Press. For us, it's exactly what we were looking for and don't mind paying the premium. When turn the thing on, sparkles from your Fairy Godmothers wand don't surround this coffee maker. Don't expect that. Buy good beans from the region you like with the roast you like and take the time to experiment with the amount of grinds and type of grind. Once you dial that in, you'll extract the true performance out of this machine. I've bought many makers looking for the holy grail of coffee makers (so I don't have to go back to French Press), and none of them lived up to my expectation. Hence, the 4 star review. Trust me, I expected the sparkles when I flipped the thing on and drank my first cup. It didn't happen and it won't. To break it down even more for you: plan to pay 200% more for this coffee maker to get 50% better coffee. For you financial planners and money/profit freaks...this rate of return will drive you crazy. Take a deep breath and just buy the thing if you want a better cup of coffee than what your Krups, Mr Coffee, Black and Decker, etc., etc. will give you. Let's be honest, its only $300. It's not a house, Apple stock or a plane. Life is too short to drink bad coffee. P.S. Don't use the brown or bamboo Milita filters or anything similar. Just get the plain white ones. Trust me.

The filter cup and the mechanism to regulate coffee flow through the grounds and filter is a very poor design.

Here you go: Pros: + Coffee tastes consistently delicious and is delivered as hot as I can imagine anyone wanting it (without overheating it) + Level markings on pre-brew water-holding reservoir are easy to read + Easy to pour water into wide open water reservoir + Parts are easy to detach and clean + Uses standard #4 Melitta-brand or Melitta-type cone filters + Brews 40 ounces of coffee in 6 minutes (when water hits the grounds until coffee stops draining from basket) + Filter basket drain opening can be adjusted via its mechanical switch for full, half, or closed draining rate. Great for manipulating immersion time. + Filter basket drain opening can be closed off completely at end of brew cycle to eliminate drips during the disposal of spent grounds + Insulated Carafe temperature starting coffee temperature of 181 F goes to 173 F in 1 hour - long enough to pour four 10-ounce cups of hot coffee + After getting the hang of it, pouring coffee from the carafe through the travel lid (NOT through the brew-through lid) is easy and accurate. You just need to ensure that the travel lid is twisted open so that one of the four notches on the threaded part of the lid is facing away from the carafe handle, so that when the carafe is tilted, the coffee will flow smoothly through the notch, across the level part of the carafe, and into your coffee cup + After transferring brewed coffee from supplied carafe to my thermos, the coffee temperature measured 180 degrees F + Water approaches filter basket from shower head at 199.9 degrees F (as tested on my coffee maker) + Insulated Carafe eliminates need for a hot plate that usually comes with a glass carafe. Note that adding heat to brewed coffee ruins it; the insulated carafe is a good thing. + Carafe is well-balanced for pouring coffee + Very quiet operation, and it's fun to watch the heated water ascend its tube + Low-key, industrial, classic appearance + Uncomplicated and robust electrical design - built to last and therefore it's environmentally friendly + One power switch runs the whole machine + Unit will only draw brewing-level power IF: 1) the carafe is placed right next to the unit, AND, 2) there is water present in the reservoir to be heated, AND, 3) the power switch is in the ON position. Unit draws hardly any power if any one of these conditions are not met. Great safety feature! + SCAA-approved maker for brewing temperature, brew-time duration (very few makers attain this) + It’s the go-to coffee maker for many baristas and coffee enthusiasts + Tons of helpful videos online with about this maker + A bit expensive, but made with living-wage labor wages in Holland, not slave-labor wages in China, so no wonder it costs what it does (yes, I consider this a 'pro') + Heavy-duty power cord helps ensure that the unit will receive the electrical current it demands while brewing (current draw varies - I tested it) + Overflow channel on the filter basket will help prevent mess in the kitchen / device damage should the filter basket clog + Parts assemble easily but somewhat loosely, and therefore will not wear or fatigue when taking apart and reassembling components + Water dispenser arm over filter basket may be swung out of the way to load filter and grounds (an alternative to removing the filter basket to load it) + Filter basket is accessible during brewing cycle if you want to stir grounds while brewing (to aid wetting of grounds for max extraction) + 5-year warranty - that’s a confident statement of quality Cons: - A bit of a learning curve to skillfully manipulate and use all of the detachable parts - Pouring stream of coffee from carafe via brew-through lid is quite poor - it's better to pour coffee using the travel lid (see 'Pros', above). Bit of a hassle to switch from the brew-through lid to travel lid just to get a decent pour. - Accidentally leaving the mechanical switch on the filter basket in closed position will likely result in a mess - Slightly-sweet odor coming from the water reservoir and carafe gasket areas (I think this may be an adhesive, and the smell seems to be dissipating; regardless, it doesn’t affect the coffee taste) - Numerous Amazon reviews report that the insulated carafe either fails or does not retain heat (mine is fine). - A medium-fine grind of 65.2 grams of (my) coffee (SCAA-recommended amount for 40 ounces of water) will have the brewing basket on the verge of overflowing while brewing, even with the basket valve fully open. A finer grind of coffee might just make it overflow. Comments: I’m already comfortable using this unit (10-day or so learning curve) in spite of having to manipulate its many detachable parts. This coffee maker may not be for everyone - not necessarily because of the price, but for the number of parts that need to be used and managed. But my patience is paying off, knowing that every morning I will be brewing up a consistently excellent pot of coffee and enjoying it. I chose this brand over Bonavita, Behmor, or Oxo brands because I have more confidence in the integrity of an expensive device hand-made in Holland than mass-produced devices made in a factory in China. Plus, I'm leery about the integrity of the electronics in especially the Behmor or Oxo units. I will say I came soooo close to buying a Bonavita BV1900TS. I hope this helps my fellow Amazonians make an informed purchase decision. Hope you enjoy your coffee! Not part of the review - two bits of valuable advice: 1. One technique I read about involves draining out any taste that the paper coffee filter itself may impart to the brewed coffee. Simply done by heating up a cup or so of water and pouring it over the filter and discarding that water, then proceeding to load the filter (in its basket) with coffee grounds, and then begin the brewing process. I did this with a Melitta brown #4 filter and WOW... pronounced cardboard-y paper smell! Then I tried same with a white Melitta filter - hardly any cardboard-y smell. So, if you use a brown filter, be sure to rinse it with hot water first. Probably best to use white filters. As the reviewer who suggested using white filters said, 'trust me - just do it'. 2. To help obtain a more complete extraction of coffee from the grounds: using a spoon, I push the grounds that accumulate on the edge of the basket filter (and floating in the liquid) into the middle to submerge the grounds. I do this once after a minute, and then again at 3 minutes into the brewing cycle.",Pros and cons - review updated weekly as experience gained,Amazon,6

I received my Technivorm as a wedding gift... otherwise there is no way on earth I would have spent this kind of money on a coffee maker. But I have to admit, I'm incredibly pleased with it after 6 years of nearly daily use. The carafe is really surprisingly effective at keeping coffee hot compared to other thermal carafes I have used, so effective in fact that I have occasionally returned home after a full day of work to pour a cup of coffee that is still steaming. The stainless inside of the carafe resists staining pretty effectively even though I habitually leave coffee in it after brewing... I just rinse it out with water and occasionally wash with dish soap and a brush and it does great. Only twice in six years have I needed to use bleach, and I just pour a small amount into a full carafe of hot tap water and let it sit overnight, and in the morning it's spotlessly clean like a brand new unit. The same ease of ownership holds true for the water reservoir and heating element... they seem exceptionally resistant to hard water scale, and even though I am on heavily scale-producing well water which clogs my hot water heater every other year, the reservoir on my Technivorm has never visibly stained and I have only needed to run cleaning vinegar through the unit a few times a year to keep it brewing quickly and effectively. I have used all kinds of beans, from small batch artisan roasts (amazing) to the cheapest mass market stuff from the grocery store. Other than slight adjustments to the amount of ground coffee (usually based simply on grind coarseness), it has needed absolutely no help in making truly amazing coffee, pot after pot. For very coarse grinds I use the half-closed position on the drip basket to slow the process, and for medium and finer grinds I leave it fully open. The drip basket lid is removable during the brew process, so with really good coffee it's possible to stir the grinds to promote 'bloom' of flavors as the brew progresses. Technivorm makes replacement parts available, so I have full expectation that I will continue to use this single maker for many years to come, and will just replace small parts as needed if that situation arises. That fits well with my general philosophy on appliances: wherever possible, buy well-made things that are repairable and try to keep them forever. The up-front cost is higher but over time it has paid off massively... the four coffee makers I went through in the two years prior to owning this Technivorm supports that anecdotally in my own experience. My only dislikes on this unit are the plastic bottom tray that sits under the carafe, and the flimsy plastic feel of the brew basket and lid. The bottom tray is merely a design disagreement - it clips under the edge of the main tower base and is simply held by the weight of the tower. This works perfectly fine as long as the coffee maker is never moved, but if I were pulling the unit out from under a cabinet each time (I'm not), I would quickly lose my patience with it. I understand that the traditional non-thermal glass carafe versions of the unit have an integrated hot plate here, so I understand the design compromise that they were going for, but they could have executed it a little better I think. The plastic used in the brew basket and lid (and for that matter, the support ring for the brew basket) have a flimsy feel to them, which irritates somewhat on a device this expensive. On the other hand, they seem to be made of something incredibly durable, because after six years of rinsing the brew basket out and banging it on the side of my sink to remove the excess water, it has yet to crack. It also seems impervious to staining or crusting up with coffee residue, because it wipes absolutely clean with a paper towel and has never supported the growth of mold, even when I have stupidly left used grounds in the covered basket and left town for a week or more. That's a classic surprise that I'm sure isn't unique to me - the fuzzy old grounds routine that makes you feel like a terribly unclean person. Yet after a quick dump of the bad grounds and filter, the plastic surfaces have never supported any kind of residue adhesion or mold growth... a quick wash is all that has been necessary. It should be noted that I never put any of these pieces in the dishwasher, so I have no idea how the plastic would stand up to that treatment. My quick and rather lazy handwashing with a bit of dish soap and a brush has kept the unit pretty much spotless, so I don't see the need. In summary: the Technivorm Moccamaster KBT741 is absolutely one of the best, if not THE best, drip coffee makers on the planet. The function of the unit just can't be criticized - it is consistent and reliable, and the product overall is just exceptionally well-executed. There are a few small gripes with some of the plastic parts, but it's preference only and unrelated to actual function. Overall, the thing just does what it is supposed to do and does it reliably without exception. Highly recommended.",No substitute. The best drip coffee maker on the market.,Amazon,8

The good part---it does, as promised, make very good coffee.  But it is fussy and temperamental.  I have never had trouble making coffee before!  Here are the issues.  The basket has a little plastic switch with 3 settings--for full pot, half pot, or to stop water flow.  The problem is that it is VERY easy to accidentally bump the lever from the half pot setting to the stop setting--in washing or even just as you put it into place---and then the basket overflows or the water just sits there until you go to pour and realize the pot is empty.  After several mess ups I finally put tape across the switch so it can't get into the stop position.  Also, according to the directions, the coffee maker should not start to brew unless the pot it in place.  On two separate occasions mine spontaneously started to brew after I had added water but had not put the pot or basket in place.  Another mess!

The base upon which the carafe sits easily comes unattached from the unit if you slide the machine around the counter and the cord is rather bulky. The cone that holds the coffee grounds simply sits in place, rather than being permanently attached. This is all fine if it simply sits in place on your countertop (in fact, it makes the unit easy to keep clean), but if you have a small kitchen or you wish to keep it on a shelf and only take it out occasionally, it might be worth taking into consideration.","Two Years Later, Still Brewing Great Coffee",Amazon,15

It's all great as many have said as well as the Cooks Illustrated Test Kitchen. The problems with this apparently older model are minor yet annoying... the basket has a slide switch for closing the drip hole or reducing the opening to lengthen the brew time. It has a flat spring which can be dislodged (which I did early on) and I have never been able to adjust it so it will close without dripping and it can only operate in max open because the smaller opening is now too small and will eventually over top the basket. The second issue is the safety button that turns the brewer on when the carafe is in place and off when it is not in place... there is a flange on the back of this silicone button that randomly gets caught on a screw when engaged. If you have the main switch on it will start the brew process before you are ready. The last issue concerns the brew arm and has been discussed in other reviews... it doesn't wet all the grounds until almost the end of brew because of the hole configuration or something. That may be good since fresh grounds are constantly being 'added' to the steeping basket. Another issue is that the brew arm appears to be chrome plated brassy looking metal and the plating has eroded around the holes. I have a mantra for preparing the brew to counter these minor shortcomings... I double check the main switch is off (there is a red light on the rocker switch but, when in the on position, it's tilted towards the back and is hard to see), I operate the basket slider switch on and off a couple times and leave it in the max flow position. Since my wife doesn't seem to grasp the problems (just the messy consequences), I now set up the coffee maker the night before and all she has to do in the morning is grind the coffee, put it in the basket (filter is already in) and turn on. Our carafe keeps things hot enough for us for as long as we need and we have no spillage issues when pouring.",Excellent... just a couple minor issues,Amazon,1

When the unit arrived, I brewed a half pot just to try it out, and it  seemed to work just fine. The coffee did not seem to be as hot as I had expected, but I chalked that up to only brewing a half pot. The next morning, I set the coffee maker up to brew a full, 10 cup pot. I left the room for a while, and when I returned the coffee had overflowed somehow onto my counter. The filter basket was the problem, not the carafe. Upon further examination, I discovered that the lever that opens the valve on the bottom of the filter basket barely moved when the basket was in place and the carafe slid in place for brewing. To fix the problem, I added a small piece of similar black plastic to the end of the lever. The added piece measures about 9mm x 10mm x 2.5mm thick. I attached it to the lever with JB Weld epoxy after taking the gloss off of both plastic surfaces with a file. The valve now opens perfectly and the coffee flows into the carafe as it should and the coffee in the carafe is as hot as it should be. After making this minor adjustment, I am quite happy with the coffee maker and the coffee it produces. My primary reason for buying Technivorm Moccamaster is the quality of the parts used by the manufacturer.

The Moccamaster makes the best tasting coffee hands down. However I feel there is room for improvement with the construction. The carafe is not the best insulator.  It does NOT keep coffee hot for 5 hours, as one reviewer stated.  In fact, it cools considerably within the first hour.  It is a given in our house that once you are onto your second cup, you will take it directly to the microwave and zap it for one minute to bring it to the temperature of your first cup.  So that's a bummer.  The second complaint is with the manual adjust drip-stop switch. It is flimsy and if you are not careful, it gets jammed.  And my 3rd complaint is with the float activated brew function switch in the water reservoir.  It gets clogged with minerals from water and all of the sudden one day your coffee maker stops working.  A good descaling cleaner corrected the problem the first time, but this time the cleaning is not having any effect. So at this point, we are wondering... do we send the coffeemaker in for repair at a cost of $50?  Once we get it back, will everything else hold up?  Not sure what to do.  But one this is certain.

The brewed coffee is much smoother and less acidic.  For those who prefer a more acidic cup, you may like the Bonavita better.  However, I am not a fan of the acidic taste, and it bothers my stomach.  I had a Bonavita - which is still a WONDERFUL coffee maker, especially for the much lower price point, however, I prefer the Technivorm so much more, that I am willing to spend this much money on it.

I tried both regular and flavored coffees, and as I said above, I liked it enough to spend a significant amount of $ on it, even though I had an excellent coffee maker already.

We get green beans from Sweet Maria's, roast weekly in a Behmor, and grind with a Rancilio Rocky. This does make the best-tasting coffee I've had. It brews very fast. I appears to be quite well-made. So, why not 5 stars? 1) The capacity is small. Distinctly smaller than our previous Krups '10 cup' machine. Really, would it have killed you to make the water reservoir and carafe a bit wider? 2) The 'thermal' carafe is basically useless. It does not keep the coffee warm. 3) The coffee comes out a lot 'dirtier' than with the Krups. I infer because the water runs a lot faster. The maker recommends paper filters, but why buy a premium coffeemaker and then filter the taste out? 4) The panel below the carafe is annoying. It won't stay attached, and basically doesn't do anything. We took it off. 5) The safety switch and 'carafe holder' mitigate against using a different carafe. I'm going to have to modify it to use a proper glass-lined carafe.  Contrary to the maker's recommendation we use a standard #4 gold filter and it has caused no problems. So, pleased with it in general, but it could definitely be improved. If it had 25% more capacity and a glass-lined carafe it would be about perfect. Follow-up after 2 months of daily. About the same as what I said before. It does make the best coffee we've ever had. for some, that's all there is to say. :) The carafe is still not 'thermal' in any meaningful sense and we've taken to preheating the carafe, AND a glass-lined real thermal carafe.

Does Moccamaster coffee taste a notch or two better than coffee from other drip brewers?  Yes.  However, this brewer is not as convenient to use every day as others.  You have to stay on your game to use this brewer. Not programmable, and there is less coffee per batch--uses European 4 oz cup size instead of American 8 oz.  Fortunately I received this just when I'd decided to cut down my daily caffeine intake. My comparison brewer is Cuisinart DTC-975BKN 12-cup programmable thermal which I used for years.  I store whole beans in air-tight container and grind fresh for every pot.  I usually use Starbucks French roast from Costco but often try other quality beans.After a few years of use, Cuisinart took around 15 minutes to brew 10-12 cups.  Too long of a brew cycle leads to bitterness.  Moccamaster brews quickly, 6-7 minutes until the filter basket stops dripping.  This is ideal, according to coffee taste experts.  The coffee is hot, but not extremely hot like typical Starbucks.  The carafe keeps coffee drinking hot for 2-3 hours. Pros -Coffee taste is excellent (even the last cold swallow left in your cup is good) -Brew cycle is fast -Thermal carafe is adequate Cons -Carafe has a screw-in brew cycle top and a separate after-brew top.  So after each brew you have to change carafe top before the heat escapes -Brew switch can stay ON but heat is activated only when a) water is in reservoir and b) carafe is in place and pressed against safety switch (If you don't pay attention and leave the switch ON, it's easy to forget, put the carafe in place and start your brew cycle before you have your coffee basket set up.  Since the switch does not turn off automatically, I set a timer every time I brew to remind me to turn off the switch) -Manual drip-stop lever on filter basket (Unlike most makers which use a spring-loaded valve, this has a manual lever to stop the drip if you want to pour a cup mid-brew.  I turn the drip lever off when I swap out the carafe tops.  It's easy to forget, wash the basket, then start next morning brew with the valve still in the OFF position.) Summary- Yes, the coffee is better.  But you have to be alert and do a little more work with this quirky Dutch brewer.","Yes, better tasting coffee, but more steps to brewing ritual and smaller quantity",Amazon,8

However, I want to highlight a particular design flaw on the Technivorm Moccamaster. The cord comes straight out the back of the unit. The cord is also very thick and inflexible. This means you cannot push the back of the unit flush with your countertop wall. The cord always gets in the way, and the unit cannot be squared up against the wall, if that makes sense. So, it's annoying that the unit cannot be placed in a permanent position on my countertop. It is constantly moving slightly as I push the pot in and out. It's also a 'spongy' feeling as I push the coffee pot into the unit, as the cord moves and shifts against the wall and then pushes the unit out once I let go. I would expect a better build quality from a product that is this high-end. A cord-wrap type system should be provided that allows the cord to exit from the left, right, or 'up' out of the back. The cord should be more flexible and allow you to push the unit against the wall without it moving.",Nein Stackenblocken! Huge design flaw in cord placement at back of unit.,Amazon,29

You must switch it off manually after the brew cycle is finished, and since you pour the brewed coffee through the 'brew tru' lid, the coffee doesn't quite keep it's full warmth by the time you get down to the bottom of the potful of coffee.

In the old days, there was only one company in the U.S. importing this product and the build quality was very high. The second brewer works well, and makes very good coffee, but the thermal carafe has two interrelated problems I never had with the first. The rim is not well made and creates dribbles down the side of the carafe as you return it to a vertical position after filling your cup. This leads to coffee staining whatever the carafe is placed on. I have to use a napkin as a bib every time I pour. I've not had this problem with any other coffee pot or carafe. The second problem is that the dribbled coffee runs behind the black band at the top of the carafe and continues to leak at the same time the rim dribbles. The whole thing is a big mess. After putting up with this for a year, I am going to try to push the retailer to send me a new (hopefully redesigned or properly fabricated) carafe. Update to original review: The retailer refused to go beyond the original warranty (I should have addressed the problem sooner), so I contacted the manufacturer through their U.S. office. To their credit, they shipped me a replacement carafe at no cost to me. The odd thing is that, while the replacement did not present the leaking problem, the screw-in cap fit very poorly. Ironically, the original cap fit the replacement carafe perfectly, so I returned the original bad carafe and the replacement cap.

I am not a coffee nut. I have an Aero Press, I have a few funnels for drip, I have a stove top espresso machine and wore out a low priced counter top espresso maker, ,also two grinders. All this to say I have been buying good beans and grinding them myself for the last 25 years or so. Now that I am near 70 I can't say as my taste buds can discern all the nuances of fine coffee that a dedicated seeker of perfect coffee needs to have, so an excellent quality automatic drip coffee machine makes a lot of sense for me. I put in 6c water (24oz) and about 45g ground coffee in the paper filter. This gives me great dark strong coffee. at 8c I use about 56g of coffee. I haven't had cause to brew 12c so I can't say how it does, but I bet it is fine as it has been great over the last 3-4 months doing what I ask of it. I suspect the key to the quality is the consistent water temperature. The other thing to mention is that it brews quickly, seems like it does 6c in 2-3 minutes. I find the thermal carafe to be excellent and it keeps the coffee at a suitable drinking temp for me for more than 1 hour. That's enough for me.

3968,Technivorm Moccamaster,"May 12, 2014","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,5,"I am a fanatic for good coffee, and I spend an average of $15/week on good quality beans from a third wave roaster. So I didn't flinch at shelling out some cash for a fantastic machine. I used to make my coffee in a cup at a time in a pour-over Hario V60, but I wanted to simplify my morning routine without compromising on coffee quality. The Technivorm exceeded my expectations, giving me a quick and easy way to make a delicious pot of coffee. In fact, the end result was much tastier than an impatient pour-over, which was a common occurrence on a rushed morning. Most coffee makers don't get water hot enough to properly extract coffee (and fluctuate in temperature throughout the brew cycle). Most $100 machines will give you water between 160 and 180F, leaving you with a weak and sour under-extracted brew. The Technivorm gives you a steady temperature of 200F throughout the brew cycle, yielding a proper extraction and a much better cup. I also work at home most days, so I'll wait a couple hours on my second cup (the 10 cup size is great for two people - 4 biggish (~10oz) cup, two for each of us). The well-insulated carafe keeps the coffee hot and fresh. It'll stay warm all day. The pour-thru spout is a nice touch too, allowing the carafe to be well sealed while brewing. My only complaint has to do with the switch on the side of the brewing basket. This is a neat feature, allowing a proper extraction of a half-pot, the switch itself is a little bit finicky. It sometimes gets stuck closed, resulting in an overflow of hot water and coffee grounds. Disassembling and reassembling the switch mechanism does fix this problem (info and picture here: [...]). That said, it's still well-deserving of a five star review. If you only drink coffee for the caffeine, fine, go for a cheaper machine. But if you really like good quality coffee and want it to taste its best, you won't regret the purchase of this machine and a good quality grinder.",Think $300 is too expensive for a coffee maker?

With my previous  'department store' coffee makers the grind of the bean had to be perfect for the coffee to be okay.  Decided to try the Moccamaster, the reviews were so overwhelmingly good.  I was not disappointed.  Moccamaster brews fast and the coffee is HOT and flavorful.  The grind of the bean does not have to be perfect to get a great cup of coffee.  I actually bought some pre-ground Starbucks coffee from Stop & Shop (never done that before) and it was fine.  Some of the reviews said you need to buy Moccamaster coffee filters (to avoid overflow), but you don't.  Run of the mill cone filters work.  The carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours. The only thing I would have done different is buy the automatic shut off.  The cord and the plastic coaster?  Who cares -- the coffee is so far beyond the other coffee makers I've had.

3973,Technivorm Moccamaster,"April 27, 2014","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,3,"Let me first dispense with my qualifications as a coffee snob in the event that makes my opinion worth any more or less, plus it will give some background on my perspective.  My main brew methods are chemex pour over, french press, or espresso with my la pavoni.  My beans come from about ten micro lots worldwide, although mainly Latin and South America, and I start to get a little prickly if the roast date is greater than 7-10 days ago (I usually get weekly delivery from two roasters).  I care about the varietals.  I conspicuously consume single varietals like gesha and SL28.  I adjust my grind by varietal and roast.  While it depends on my grind, my water needs to be about 200-202 degrees; I don't care for the bitter compounds extracted at higher temperatures, particularly with the extra contact time in a press or pour over.  SBUX is the devil.  I'm up there in snobbery. My wife was getting sick of the labor and attentiveness with the pour over.  I hadn't been pulling too much espresso because 1) my wife doesn't like espresso and 2) it's too much of a pain to change beans and grinds on my Rancilio.  I could have bought another Rancilio to accommodate the other beans, but I'd also achieve single status at the same time.  All of this culminated in our discussing the Technivorm.  It was a practical concession for me. The Techivorm is less expensive than some of my other coffee brewing paraphernalia; but it is expensive, so I expect either a leap in design over a Mr Coffee and / or some nicely engineered parts.  First the technology: a nice young percolator walks into a bar and has a bit too much to drink.  In walks a beautiful hand-made Italian espresso machine.  One thing leads to another.  The next morning she looks over and sees a Mr. Coffee snoring loudly.  Nine months later the Technivorm is born.  That's really the story on the technology.  I don't expect much from a drip but, if I was the engineer, I would basically try to emulate a perfect pour over.  This would include perfect water temperature and evenly rinsing the grinds with a constant flow of water.  It doesn't matter if the output arm has nine holes or one, the water is really only meaningfully covering a pie slice of the grinds.  I verified this twice by stirring the grinds mid brew.  This is more meaningful for people that use freshly roasted coffee because there is more trapped CO2 resulting in a larger bloom.  This bloom elevates grinds above the water level and they never get brewed.  Therefore there is a whole range of uncontrolled extraction occurring that will keep me up at night.  Think of the children!  In terms of brew temperature I haven't checked.  I am afraid too.  It'll go straight to my craw.  I would think that given that the water travels back up a tube through the middle of the water reservoir that the temp of the water hitting the grinds would be a function of the temperature of the water in the reservoir.  Maybe the plastic tube is thick enough and this is moot. For the engineering: I would have expected more, similar to other reviewer's comments.  Machined metal?  Maybe not, but I think bespoke CNC'd / molded plastics is appropriate at this price point.  The top for the water reservoir, if I threw it in my junk drawer, would get lost amongst flimsy tupperware tops that are in search of their lost bottoms.  It doesn't fit well.  Everything else ex the percolator parts could have come from a cheap Mr Coffee.  I would have expected more precise machining / molding of the parts.  The opening for the outlet arm is about 160% too big. How's it taste?  Not bad, and I guess this is all that matters.  It isn't as perfect as a good pour over.  I wouldn't be able to tease the best out of a nice rare varietal by playing with any brew levers.  It is masquerading as a prosumer gadget, and it just isn't.  For comparison, my grinder is about $70 more expensive and it weighs 20lbs and has precision parts.  That's what I expect from prosumer goods.  For most mornings before work it is fine, and my wife is happy. In summary: Pros: - not a bad cup of coffee - carafe is convenient (although I agree with another reviewer that it would have been better if the innards were glass; the coffee skunks fast in metal) - Auto shut off (I think there may be one, but I could be wrong.  After it brews I hear a relay or a solenoid or something click  I would think there would have to be or else they'd be replacing elements constantly) Cons: - Less than ideal price-to-quality - Cheap parts - Water arm doesn't evenly saturate grinds nor pump / drain at a rate such that the grinds are submerged - The kill switch that the carafe must engage to actuate the element is a clunky design - Water boils at circa 212 degrees (depending on the dissolved solids).  Then it travels up the technitube and out the technihole at ??? temperature","Probably the Best of it's Type, but the Price to Quality Ratio is a Bit too High",Amazon,9

3977,Technivorm Moccamaster,"March 30, 2014","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,5,"I give this coffeemaker 5 stars for the following reasons. --Superb quality coffee. Literally will brew a perfect cup every single time.. this machine continually amazes me. --Outstanding build quality --Allows use of skill to customize each brew (via the flow control switch and the brewhead swing arm and filter cup) The downsides:  learning curve, plastic pieces are lightweight and need to be handled with care, needs some babysitting. This coffeemaker initially frustrated me.. there is some difficulty finding the perfect grind size if you want it to brew automatically.  The first 10 or so batches had problems with under or overextracting.  I personally found the best solution is to use a slightly coarser grind and then let the coffee steep as the filter basket fills with water .. swiveling the grind arm as it brews (or rotating the basket with the arm slightly skewed to the side) (note: this is a slight burn risk if you are fully asleep).  The use of a stopwatch greatly improves this technique.  Left unattended,  you need to really perfect a finer grind that will depend on pot size.  Too fine and of course it wont drain fast enough or will overflow.. too coarse and you cant hope to get close to a 3-4minute brew time without taking some time with the valve closed to steep the grinds. That said, since I have dialed in my 4:30 brew time and since using the modified , somewhat manual brew method, I consistently get what tastes like the best cup of coffee ive ever had, every time, even with moderate quality beans (lowest level of bean ive tried in this was 3 month old '8 o clock original).  It's worth mentioning,  if youre shelling out for this machine, please use a conical burr grinder, this brewer quickly exposes flaws in poor grind quality). This machine seriously has changed how I view coffee.  Coming from french press and a $20 mr coffee, this machine is the best of both worlds.  The coffee tastes incredibly clean while simultaneously tasting very powerful and complex.  It has the flavor of french press without that oily bitterness(from residual extraction of suspended solids) or that overly heavy flavor that can plague this method. The one complaint I can see some people having with this machine is that it is not as easy to use as a Mr. Coffee.. this is not a fully automated system. .. but nothing that is fully automated can match this quality.  I have had coffee that is 'as good' as the technivorm's from a chemex or manual pour-over brews.. the advantage of the TV over these brew methods is in its consistency and ease of use in comparison. Is it worth $300?  .. I think a large part of the price relates to the proven consistency of this company, the long warranty, availability of cheap replacement parts, and the fact that this is the only drip coffeemaker in this class of quality.  The bonavita, which is $150 cheaper, may make coffee that tastes similar, but the vacuum-carafe implosion problem alone is enough to tell you that the technivorm's competitors are not playing in the same league with regard to design/build quality. If you want the absolute best drip coffeemaker on the market, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the TV ..  it is a 'must-have'.  If you want a very high quality coffeemaker that will do everything for you and work perfectly without any effort .. this is not the machine for you -- the necessity of applying some skill and fine tuning is what allows this machine to brew *perfect* coffee every time,  in any batch size.","moderate learning curve, best quality coffee imaginable",Amazon,4

Having purchased the machine at Williams Sonoma when they provided a lifetime in-store warranty for all electrics they sold, I returned the coffee maker hoping to replace it with another.  I was informed that they no longer sold Capresso machines, but they made an even exchange for the Technivorm.  I have only had it for 2 days, but I can offer my initial comments.  Although several reviewers have commented that this machine does not produce hot enough coffee, I have found that to be far from the case.  My first sip would have burned my mouth had I not been forewarned by the sales associate at Williams Sonoma.  The coffee produced has so far been very smooth and without a trace of bitterness.  I have found it easy to clean, and it takes no longer to brew and clean up after than most others. I gave the machine 4 stars instead of 5 for several reasons.  First of all, the one omission that I have found to be most glaring is an automatic shut off following brewing.  I do not know for sure whether the heating element shuts off automatically, but the power indicator indicates otherwise.  I suspect that forgetting to shut off the power may result in shortening the life of the machine.  I also do not particularly like having to brew into an open thermal carafe.  It would have made more sense to offer something similar to the Capresso, where the brew goes directly into the thermal carafe's top and the coffee is sealed, requiring a simple turn of the top to pour. Overall, I like this machine, but if I had to choose between the now unavailable Capresso unit which died and the Technivorm, I would choose the former.

We were very happy with the purchase until this week At the bottom of water container there is a small compartment in which a floats sits. This compartment never dries out as such a green slime starts to grow on the side of the compartment like it would in an aquarium. We've used Vinegar and Dezcal to try and clean the machine. While the Dezcal may kill the bacteria it does not remove the buildup on the sides of the container.  After each cleaning the green slime comes back faster and faster. After seeing this disgusting build up accumulate over the last 1 year we decided to try to clean the compartment.  The metal cover over the float would not come off so we tried to remove the water container. The water container does not come off either.  In the process we broke the glass tube that brings the boiling water up to the top. This should no big deal. With all our other appliance (Black and Decker Kitchen Aid, Frigidaire, Phillips) all we've had to do is call the service center and have the parts shipped out. This is not the case with Technivorm USA. They refuse to sell the parts. Worse since the repair is not a warranty issue Techiworm USA does not have any repair facilities, NONE ZIP ZERO.

After a week of 'tests', I can say that it does produce slightly less-bitter coffee, but not by too much -- still a long way from the Technivorm hype and my hopes for delicious coffee (like you remember from Europe).  But my big disillusionment is with the 'Thermo-Carafe' model, which I have returned. The 'Thermo Carafe' model has a fashionable-looking brushed stainless steel vessel with a plastic base.  Its name implies that the carafe keeps the coffee warm.  But the OPPOSITE is true.  It is not a thermos flask.  Unless it is pre-heated with hot/boiling water, the metal carafe quickly leeches the heat from the incoming dripped coffee.  So the immediate cup is OK, but if you wait some minutes before the next cup, the coffee has already become tepid.  Unlike a glass carafe model, there can be no warming soleplate. Other people have noted this and recommended: (a) pre-heating the carafe with warm/boiling water and (b) decanting the brewed coffee immediately into a genuine thermos flask.  This is not my idea of convenient coffee making and drinking.  To justify this effort, the resulting coffee flavor would have to be amazing (and it is not).  Calling this model 'Thermo Carafe' seems to be deliberately deceptive marketing on the part of the manufacturer. Several other niggles.  The metal carafe prevents you from seeing how much coffee is in it.  There is no auto-drip pause, so you have to peer (if there is enough light) into the narrow crack between the cone and the carafe, to ascertain whether dripping has stopped, before retrieving any coffee.  The carafe has a screw-in insert that makes washing it out a nuisance.  There is a thin bottom plastic plate (doing what?) that awkwardly gravity-attaches to the body of the machine and falls off whenever the machine is elevated.  As an engineer, I am amazed at the user-unfriendly, thoughtless, design of this 'top-end' Thermo-Carafe machine. Having said this, I have become aware (too late) of other versions of the Technivorm Moccamaster that have a glass carafe and a heating soleplate.  This makes much more sense. On the other hand, once bitten twice shy.  So I renewed my web searching, and I discovered an extremely inexpensive Mr Coffee drip machine that was rated joint first in consumer tests of 100 machines.  Amazon sells it, and I have ordered it.

I bought it for the heat when my Capresso quit. The Capresso was brewing so cold I had to microwave for 30 seconds right after pouring. Now, I have a very sensitive mouth that burns easily so I figured I would have to wait a bit before taking my first sip. To my surprise, I could and should drink right after brewing as it was just the right temp. The coffee was no better or worse than other cheapo makers I've used. So, in conclusion, if you are buying this to extract the most flavor from your coffee based on advertised brewing temp, you won't be impressed. I guess you won't be disappointed either, but for $300 I expected my socks to be knocked off and it didn't happen. By comparison, coffee from Duncan Donuts in an uninsulated cup has to sit 15-20 minutes in a cold car before I can sip it. That's hot. Technivorm is not... Update. After three luke warm coffee experiences, it's boxed up and going back. The maker was simply not putting out any hotter than a $29.99 Walmart special. (In fact, the cheapo one actually bought at Walmart in our RV is hotter!) I suppose I could have gotten a defective one, but after using mine for a few mornings, it's not only the cool coffee, but the complication of use that has turned me off trying a replacement. All the parts, the switching of carafe lids after brewing, the fact that you can't put the carafe back on the base with the thermo lid screwed in, etc. etc. all jaded my experience. The Bonivita looks to operate the same way with the same downfalls so I guess it's back to mainstream makers. On top of all that, even with the slider slowing the brew the coffee was still coming out weaker than what I'm used to from cheaper units. Something really wrong here so thank goodness for Amazon's excellent return policy. What I can do in closing is recommend a fantastic alternative.

I bought this(from an independent coffee supplier) about 5ish years ago.  I also went ahead and got a permanent gold filter to avoid paper.  From the beginning the water release mechanism in the coffee basket wasn't working optimally and we had to replace the basket within a couple of years and actually should have replaced it sooner.  It's really a pretty cheaply made thing overall(coffee basket) and even with the new one which works properly, it's not great.  We check on the coffee grounds to make sure they are all getting wet because sometimes they don't;  so we move the basket around or the overhead water spigot...  I also agree the carafe does not keep the coffee warm even if I put hot water in before hand and the pour is far from ideal because there isn't an actual neck for the coffee to follow.  Plus the coffee that comes out of the maker is not hot to begin with. Last year I bought this gizmo to twist into the carafe to keep the heat in while the coffee is brewing and it does help.  But I still sometimes have to pop the coffee into the microwave anyway.  I buy quality coffee and the end product from this machine is o.k.  It's not great.  I have 6 different types of coffee makers(not one other is a drip) and I would have to say that this is my least favorite.

4028,Technivorm Moccamaster,"June 22, 2013","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,4,"There are certainly some funny reviews on this machine here. About the carafe design: yes, there's no 'spout'; you do have to do the aiming yourself.  I've made a few dozen pots of coffee with this machine, and not one drop splashed (which is odd, since the cheap Chinese machine I replaced did have a spout on the carafe, and the thing splashed all over). About the carafe thermo ability: ours keeps coffee drinkably hot for more than 30 minutes with the pour-through lid on; likely longer with the travel lid, though I've not tried it.  If you spend longer than this drinking coffee, you might brew two small pots, or try a stronger stimulant drug. About the price: it is $300.  Is that high? I wonder -- if we determined the average income of everyone who is seriously contemplating buying a $300 coffeemaker, and paid each person in the Technivorm supply chain that wage, do you think the machine would be more or less than $300?  I'll guess more. Simply because the market is flooded with products made with nearly stolen labor doesn't make this product expensive, it simply makes us realize that this is how much a product costs when folks are paid as much as we are.  (Yes, I'm ready for the comments about your low rate of pay...) Must manually stop/adjust flow out of basket: yes, at one time this was the only was the Technivorm thermo model worked.  There is now an auto-stop model (I think it is the KBGT-741) for those folks who have been trained by Asian machines to demand the automated stopping of coffee flow when removing the carafe midbrew.  Imagine how miserable life was when the only way to get a cup of coffee was to wait until the end of the brew cycle.  The horror! Machine is 'fiddly'.  Hmmm.  Not sure what that refers to exactly.  You pour the water in the reservoir, pop the lid back on or leave it off as you wish, put a filter and grounds in the basket, move the brewing arm over the basket, and put the carafe in place.  Easy when you break it down: add water, add filter and grounds, move arm, insert carafe.  Four steps.  You can set the thing up the night before if this sounds too complicated to do sans caffeine.  If this is still too fiddly for you, I have only one word of advice, and it starts with 'S' and ends with 'bucks'. Machine 'clogs': I'm assuming that what clogs is the coffee flow out of the basket. Indeed, the coffee does flow out of a hole, any size of which is theoretically prone to clogging, especially if you never clean the basket, or you brew serious motoroiljetfuelnapalmroadgravel coffee regularly, or put the grounds in the basket without a filter, or make beef gravy in it. The most instructive comment I've seen here on the design quality of the machine is this one: 'First, I have been roasting coffee since the 90s and have used many different types of brewing devices. I am not the smartest guy but I have some experience making a good cup of coffee. And I can usually work my way around things mechanically. While this machine gets high ratings for the temperature it reaches the main part that holds the coffee is the cheapest thing I have ever seen.'  I can't judge the experience level of this reviewer on anything except what is written in the review.  I'll try to help out by pointing out that 'the main part that holds the coffee' is called a 'filter basket', or 'basket' for short.  After 20 years of experience, the names of the parts of the machine (and, indeed, which part of the coffeemaker is the main part) can elude anyone, I guess. My $0.2: Great tasting coffee. First machine I received didn't work (heating element didn't function).  Replacement unit works great.  Seems solidly built out of quality materials.

I am not obsessed with coffee but interested and devoted to a 'good cup.'  Learning that Sweet Maria's, my most dependable coffee bean purveyor, does their coffee bean evaluations using a Technivorm and that Cooks Magazine rated it the best coffee maker and also uses it in their test kitchen, convinced me to pop for this pricey machine.  It promised a solution to achieving the magic target range of perfect water heat for brewing coffee, something that I had always guessed at with a kettle on the stove. This machine took three weeks of experimenting to finally produce a great cup of coffee.  I was constantly changing the grind of the beans, the quantity of grounds, etc. and always producing different versions of a disappointing, mediocre cup. The machine did not saturate the coffee grounds with its perfect temperature water and did not extract the full flavor of the beans.  After reading advice from Sweet Maria's and others, I started closing the variable outlet on the filter holder until the grounds were saturated and then tinkering with how soon to open it half-way or fully to allow the coffee to exit the grounds and drip into the carafe.  Standing over the Moccamaster and using a spoon to to distribute the water over the grounds and making sure they were all saturated before starting the flow to the carafe was also a step forward.  Waiting until the now saturated grounds had actually released the bulk of the remaining available liquid was the final step toward success.  The system works well as a producer of great coffee - it just demands personal involvement in the process.  The water spray distributor needs to be redesigned to fully cover the grounds, possibly by rotating the coffee filter holder or extending the spray pattern to the edges of the filter.  The coffee release needs to be delayed until saturation is achieved.  A sensor should notify you that the appropriate amount of coffee has been extracted from the coffee grounds and the carafe is ready to be sealed.  That would be automatic!","Great coffee, but hardly automatic",Amazon,13
4035,Technivorm Moccamaster,"May 13, 2013","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,1,"This machine was a waste of money.  First, The taste of the coffee is no better than machines costing 1/4 of the price.  While the machine does live up to its claim of a 6 minute pot and correct temperature (at least 195 degrees F; I took a reading at the spray head), the result is bitter regardless of amount or type of coffee used.  Second, the stainless steel carafe leaks because the interior of the carafe is not continuous with the spout.  Therefore, coffee is able to leak between the double walls and eventually ooze out through the small crack in the handle (and coffee does not stay hot for very long).  Clearly, the epoxy used to fasten the handle is insufficient.  Although I obtained a replacement carafe from Moccamaster, the replacement developed the same leak as well.  Moccamaster seemed disinterested in hearing any criticism of their product.  Very poor design. Finally, the unit is clunky and seems cheaply made.  I believe the unit is much praised by salespeople and those wishing to justify having thrown away a significant amount of money on an automatic drip coffee maker. I have owned many auto drip coffee makers over the past 15 years (at least 13).  The only machine that comes close to producing the smooth and non-bitter results (like those that a French press, vacuum pot, or high-end espresso machine will make) is Bunn.  A Bunn unit will put out the same amount of coffee as a Moccamaster in about 3 minutes, half the time of a Technivorm unit, and it will also heat the water to the correct temperature.  The downfall to Bunn is the reservoir requiring it to be on constantly.  I believe the key to making smooth coffee is temperature (which Technivorm has mastered) with the amount of time in which the water is in contact with the beans (which Technivorm has NOT mastered).  In fact, using a manual pour-over unit, which can cost as little as $10, one can better control these two variables and get consistently better coffee. Do yourself a favour - save your money and get a manual pour-over unit, French press, or vacuum pot.  If you are insistent of dropping $300 on a Technivorm, please seriously consider spending a little more ($500-600) and obtaining a decent espresso unit with which to make Americano.  Failing that, you will get results every bit as good as a Moccamaster from a hard-ware store machine for 1/4 of the price.",Not worth the money,Amazon,12

Here is my take: It is very expensive, it has no timer, no built-in grinder, it doesn't tie your shoelaces for you, and the top of the carafe has to be removed for brewing.  However... Once the carafe is removed from the brewer and the top is on, the coffee will stay warm all day, and taste reasonable for at least a couple of hours (as opposed to holding on a burner: 20 minutes tops); the temperature of the brew is optimal, and the taste is almost indistinguishable from manual pour-through; those multiple parts everyone hates are easily removable for optimal cleaning (cleaning is good); the transparent reservoir is neat, allowing you to see at a glance when it is brewing and when it is done.  I don't know what criterion everyone is using for build quality but in terms of absence of cheap molded plastic parts this rates far higher than typical brewers.  I've been using one for at least 5 years and it's still going strong. I have to get this out, though, and everyone anxious to pan this unit appears to have missed it: the sleek-looking new carafe is a pain to pour from.  Unless done very carefully--not easy in the morning before I've had my coffee-it will dribble and make a mess. Originally this came with a stouter, rounder, less attractive but much more functional carafe.  If you can locate one do so but they're getting hard to find.  Boyd's Coffee now sells a replacement with a brew-through lid.  Everyone wants a brew-through lid, right?  Unfortunately, pouring is not as good as the original, especially at the end, and that brew-through lid compromises thermal insulation. One Three Stooges slap to Technivorm for taking a fine product and mucking it up. Addendum, Aug. 2013: One vital thing I forgot to mention is the drip stop feature.  Almost every automatic filter drip allows you to pull the carafe out before the brew is finished.  With the TV this feature is manual, you have to move a lever to stop the drip.  Most serious coffee aficionados will not use the feature per se, unless they require different brew strengths.  What they will use it for is to let the hot water in for a couple of minutes and let it 'bloom' with the drip stop shut.  But this will burn you sooner or later.  If you leave the water dripping and the drip stop closed it will make a mess.  So I mostly ignore it.  It would be nice if it were marked in red or something when it is closed to draw your attention to it.

We have a small office so I thought the capacity of this brewer was fine. But what happend is that people in the office flat out rejected the Technivorm.  They are not coffee connoisseurs so they can't really taste the difference, plus what made it impossible is that I was the only one who knew how to brew it. There's just too many steps - from preheating the carafe with hot water, sticking the plastic tube into the carafe, remembering to open the water dispense gate on the filter basket (and choosing the right settings) to avoid spilling from top, and all the loose parts ended up intimidating the office folks to the point no one was brewing coffee anymore, which was quite tough on everyone b/c one does not simply go without coffee at the office... but when brewed right, it makes great coffee. But you know what? Bunn VPR also makes great coffee and it's so easy to use. With too much user adoption issues, it was to be returned. However I am now using this maker at home. I know, what idiot gets a Technivorm for the office right?  So I'll just give my honest review on the qualities of the brewer itself based on my usage. - Too many steps to brew great coffee (as I wrote above). - The stainless steel carafe is horrible. It's a looker but in terms of performance, it's a total stinker. Carafe does not keep coffee hot for long periods, even after I preheat it with boiling water first. After only about 1.5 hrs, coffee is warm, not hot. I don't think the carafe really insulates well... I guess it's not vacuum wall sealed? This was a big disappointment. I have a double-wall Thermos vacuum-walled mug that keeps coffee hot for hours. Not this carafe.  The top is just a screw-on plastic cap and if you touch it, it's warm, meaning there's heat exchange there. The spout is circular all around; it looks really nice but when you pour, it spreads coffee over a large area, exposing it to more air. I would imagine, there's heat loss there. With all the accolades going to this machine for the right brewing temperature, what happens to the coffee since leaving the filter basket spout is questionable. - Carafe is difficult to clean. The opening is small and carafe is tall.  I once went out of town for a week and forgot to clean the coffee out before leaving. I returned to mold growing inside. Normally, you'd want to just scrub it clean with a soapy sponge. With the limited size of the mouth opening, I put the soapy sponge inside, then with a sauce spoon, swirled the sponge around. That's really the only way to clean it. - When the carafe cap is screwed in, you can't put the carafe right below the filter holder for storing the coffee. There's not enough room for it. Bad design. - Coffee tastes weak, made with recommended dosages in the manual. It states five 2-tablespoons (I have a coffee scoop) for a 10 cup coffee. I always have to add 2-3 extra tablespoons for good, rich taste. I feel like I'm wasting coffee. - The water dispense hole on the filter basket seems to dispense water too quickly so coffee tastes weak. I then saw a youtube video of a reviewer that keeps the water dispense gate shut for the first min, then gives the coffee a stir with a spoon after 1 min, then opens the gate to let it flow, for best taste. The reason for this is that due to design, hot water is not evenly dispensed into the filter basket and the water may not reach all the grounds (plus coffee flowing too quickly). I stirred and the flavor does improve and the coffee tastes richer. And to get good coffee strength, I was resorting to doing that 1-minute stir step. Again, for me, just too many darn steps for a good cup of coffee. - Very expensive. - I personally think the design is clunky. Too many parts that come apart by design - from the water reservoir lid, the filter basket, filter basket lid, carafe tube, carafe lid... but in its defense, loose parts means the machine as a whole is much easier to clean and parts would be easy to replace over the years. This is known as a workhorse machine so I'd expect you'd keep it around for a long long time. If you're serious about Technivorm, you've probably seen Kevin Sinnott's video review of Bonavita where he states in comparison that his '30 year old Moccamaster just chugs away'. Really? 30 years?? (granted, it's the original, different model, but that's a testament to quality). So I think the design comes down to taste (no pun ha ha). [Update 5/2003] I have come to appreciate the parts that come apart by design. When I want to dump the used grinds, all I do is pick up the entire filter housing by the handle out of the machine and dunk it down the trash bin. Thats so much easier than lifting the wet filter out of the filter basket. - Water is very easy to pour into the reservoir b/c the lid comes off completely. So it's easy to pour straight from a Brita jug without spilling. This is convenient. - 5 year warranty.  That's a bid of confidence. [Update 5/2013] I still think the Technivorm requires too much hands on. I brewed 4 cups and brewed by trapping the water in the filter basket and swirling it around. Makes good coffee, strong enough. Then I brewed the same but with straight pass-thru to the cup underneath (for hands-off approach). Weaker coffee. I think one way to improve the design is to make the coffee dispense hole smaller so the water has a chance to sit with the grinds for longer periods. [Update 8/2013] Brewing has become easier. Brewing has become auto-pilot. I no longer use the carafe. Each morning, I turn the unit on. Put 2 tablespoons of beans in the grinder, pour 4 cups of water into the water reservoir, place the coffee filter in the filter basket, remembering to shut the dispense hole if not already, and when grinder is done, dump the contents into the filter. Close lids. Place heavy jar under filter basket to press the brew switch in (annoying design safety feature), let it brew. It'll sit there for a few min like French press.  Then I open the filter baseket lid, stir the coffee, then open the dispense hole into the coffee mug below. The whole process became a lot easier once I decided not to use the carafe. It's still hands on (stirring part) but it's really easy. Upping from 3 stars to 4.",Too much hands-on for a great cup... but gets easier,Amazon,4

The water distribution over the grinds is not evenly distributed so that unless you sit there and rotate the brew basket, not all the grinds will get saturated with water. Because of the variable pressure, the water ends up coming out the proximal holes of the water arm which doesn't allow even distribution of the water over the grinds. When I first started using the Technivorm, the coffee seemed almost too hot to drink, now its seems just hot enough to drink.

Makes a hot cup of coffee every time, parts clean up easily, its easy to operate, and because of its simplicity, i.e. no electronics to speak of, it should last a very long time. Here are the 3 flaws that make 'the best part of waking up...is throwing this thing across the room' 1. The shape of the pour spout of the carafe is TERRIBLE! Coffee sometimes goes every which way but into your coffee mug. This is when I picture flinging the unit through the kitchen window at 5 am. Be prepared to wipe up coffee several times a week. 2. The drip stop mechanism on the filter holder easily drops into the closed position when preparing coffee, if you don't check it every time before you begin brewing (I cant seem to remember this every morning... apparently I'm stupid) you'll end up with grinds in your coffee and a total mess. 3. The carafe is stainless steel but it is not glass lined so if the coffee sits in it for more than 45-60 minutes look out, it gets nasty tasting. This totally defeats the purpose of the sealable carafe. This isn't a huge deal but its annoying if you go back for round two or three. I have a Stanley thermos that keeps coffee hot all day yet doesn't make it taste rancid. This carafe shreds it in an hours time. I woud only buy the coffee maker again if the carafe was of a different design that poured more precisely and if they would fix or remove the drip stop function.

Big mess usually. 3. The handle snapped off the caraffe within 18 months. Still functional, but makes for an ugly machine on the counter. 4.

I had been grinding my beans for awhile with a Rancilio Rocky and using a Cuisinart coffee maker. I thought that the coffee from the Cuisinart was good until we started to drink the stuff from the TV. It just makes consistently excellent coffee, day after day, period. I was initially concerned that the unit was too big to fit into my appliance garage, but it looks good sitting on the counter, very stylish. I use a medium fine grind with the coffee, and stir the grounds after the initial bunch of hot water gets dispensed, to allow the coffee to fully bloom and develop. After stirring, I cover up the filter basket and let it drip. I use a gold filter with it, too. I have never had a problem with the lack of depressed lip on the carafe. The coffee pours neatly into the cup every time. Only con is that sometimes when brewing the maximum amount of coffee, the water pours out faster than the basket can drip, causing spillover. That would probably be fixed if using a paper filter. On the whole, I highly recommend this coffee maker.",Consistently excellent coffee for over two years,Amazon,2

Apparently most of the 5-Star crazies have no idea of what a really well-brewed cup of prime coffee tastes like. Or else it must have a huge markup for retailers who promote it endlessly as one of the best coffeemakers out there, since it absolutely, positively is NOT. First of all, there is the issue of the flavor of its brew, which is crap. This mostly comes from the over-fast brewing cycle, with all the water poured in one non-stop cycle. Temperature of the water is only *one* factor contributing to an excellent cup of coffee. Much more important is to pre-wet the grounds with boiling water, and let them steep for about 3 minutes before pouring the rest of the water in. Unfortunately, no electric coffee maker available today can do this. So for maximum flavor with a little bit of inconvenience, you're far better off manually boiling water in a teakettle and using a Melitta-filter-type setup to brew directly into a stainless-steel thermos, after first just wetting the grounds and allowing them to steep the few minutes before pouring in the rest of the water. Ostensibly, according to the marketing hype, this thing's purported ability to deliver near-boiling water to the grounds is justification for the absurdly high price of $300 or more. Yet it can't even do that, the claim is an outright lie. Water is at boiling temperature only at point of contact with the heating element, which is simple physics. It loses its temperature fast, like a degree or two per second. By the time it gets pumped out the uninsulated steel tube and into the grounds, it has cooled down closer to around 180-185 degrees F. I know, because I actually took the time and effort to test it with a high-end digital thermometer. If you don't believe me, try it yourself. If you absolutely *do* want an automatic coffee maker, the best one I can advise you on is the Melitta 46894. At about $60, it's one-fifth the price of this piece of crap, and it's well-made to boot, without all the loose pieces of cheap plastic of this abomination of a clumsy Technivorm. The Melitta has a 'robust' brewing cycle that slows down the brewing, providing a near-steeping experience and a very rich, deep cup of coffee. And it even has a timer allowing you to have it ready when you wake up, which this lousy Technivorm can't even bring itself to provide for the ripoff price. The Melitta absolutely, positively makes far better coffee than this thing. Anyone who follows my reviews knows that I have little patience for overpriced, pretentious ripoffs. And that I don't mince words in calling out manufacturers and publishers that they are simply defrauding their customers with phoney and deceitful claims. This item clearly falls into that category. If it were priced at what it's worth and what it costs to manufacture, namely about $45, I might give it 2 stars.

I see this company has released an updated version that addresses the few nit-picks I have with the original design; when this one does I will probably buy the updated model. Original review: I bought this coffee maker after reading the reviews about how great it is, and how it makes the best coffee.  I even bought an expensive bur grinder because everyone said it makes all the difference... I have now had both for several months and my conclusion... I should have kept my cheapo grinder and bought a mid-range coffee maker for half the price.  The coffee does come out noticeably hotter than previous brewers I have owned, and it does make for a slightly better brew.  Bottom line, unless you are one of these people that just has to have it because 'its the best!' (ie most expensive) then go for it.  If you are looking for a good coffee maker, save yourself some serious bank and buy a cheaper version. Pros - it makes a very hot cup of coffee quickly. Cons - the carafe is mediocre, the filter holder has a switch to assist in brew strength when making smaller pots (would be a pro if it didn't occasionally malfunction and cause the top to overflow on the counter tops), and the biggest con is that it is super over-priced for what you get.

Since he's a 'coffee snob' and orders all of our beans specially roasted and shipped he convinced me that we needed a high-end coffee brewer. It came down to this model or a Bunn. The Bunn offered durability, but quality won out over durability. The footprint of this pot is comparable to our previous brewer. It is a bit deeper, but the height fits comfortably under the counter, whereas the Bunn had reviews that it was almost too tall to do so. This brewer makes a quality cup of coffee.

It is sucked down, heated and pushed up and into the arm that drips into the grounds reservoir. There is a sliding tab that sets the drip into the carafe to closed, half (for 4 cups or less), and full open.

This unit was recommended to me by coffee growers in Kona for having the best water temperature regulator system. I was not willing to spend $300 on a coffeemaker, but received it as a gift. It definitely earns its reputation for producing great tasting coffee! There is a distinct improvement in flavor as compared to other drip machines. The coffee tastes richer and fresher, especially when ground just prior to brewing. The proper temperature really brings out the full flavor or good coffee beans. The look and feel of this machine is a bit like a high school science experiment. As stated earlier, this is not a stylish looking machine for the kitchen counter.  It is also expensive for a coffemaker. You can achieve the same level of taste with near boiling water and a french press or individual cone filter, but this machine is much easier to produce a full pot of great coffee and the simplistic nature of the coffee making parts makes it easy to clean up and maintain. The bottom line is that this machine delivers remarkable function over style, but at a price.",GREAT tasting coffee,Amazon,2

It seemed cheaply made, and I guess that is one of the gripes I had with the product--in the midst of this beautiful and expensive coffeemaker, there were such cheap parts thrown on.  One of them was a 1/8' plastic kick plate that the carafe sat on that had virtually no purpose.  It barely attached to the coffeemaker and would be left behind on the counter when you moved it.  We ended up throwing it in the drawer. Another irritation was the sheer number of parts--eight in all.  The tank cover could have been hinged but instead it was also an inexpensively made cover that you took off and on.  The coffee basket had it's own cover that was likewise not hinged to the basket.  There was a screw in funnel to catch the coffee from the basket and direct it into the carafe which you unscrewed when the coffee was finished to attach another cap to hold in the heat for the carafe.  Too many parts and all of them needing cleaning! The Technivorm also is tall.  We have custom cabinets with added molding and the extra molding wouldn't allow the TV to slide under the cabinet.  It ended up sitting in front of our kitchen window which of course detracts from a cleaner countertop. The electric cord is so thick and long and had no real place to hide--especially since it didn't slide under the cabinet.  The cord's thickness is what you'd expect to find on a window air conditioning unit.  It's unwieldy size made it sit there--again detracting from a clean countertop. The carafe design didn't allow your hand to go into the neck so cleaning required a special bottle brush (which I had not purchased before I returned the coffeemaker).  Another aspect of the carafe was the very wide area from which the coffee was poured which was not a neat spout. However, the thermal aspect of the carafe is fantastic and we would sometimes find the coffee still warm the next morning. The TV does make a perfect cup of coffee, though, which is really the reason we buy coffee makers to start with, right?  I've owned 7 different manufacturers of coffeemakers and espresso machines in the last 5 years and this was one of the best. That said, our replacement coffeemaker is the Bonavita at half the price and makes an equally perfect cup of coffee!  Both the TV and the Bonavita heat coffee to over 200 degrees for the perfect cup and temperature.  It also has a better water drip coverage area to ensure all grounds are equally included in the brew. I have to recommend the Bonavita over the TV and gave the Bonavita a solid five stars in my written rating!",Almost as good as Bonavita,Amazon,4

Quite honestly, I love the brew I get from my simple, basic $30 Cuisinart. I think the problem with the Technivorm is it brews too quickly and the coffee beans don't get a chance to steep enough to release their full flavor.  This may be due to poor design. There don't seem to be enough holes in the drip system to saturate all of the grounds.  Each time I brewed, there were actually some dry grounds left in the basket.

4086,Technivorm Moccamaster,"September 15, 2012","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,3,"I bought the Technivorm to replace my Bunn, which has provided yeoman service over the past 10 years.  I had delegated the Bunn to my attic.  My decision to buy the Technivorm was based, primarily, upon the many favorable reviews of the product. I was alarmed at the price but was delighted to find something that was not imported from China.  It seemed to be a quality product that most users were happy with. And I was fascinated to watch the water shoot up the plastic tube and into the hopper after the water had reached the appropriate temperature. Sexy! One little problem though:  the coffee didn't taste as good as that provided by my Bunn.  It tasted bitter.  Sure I tried filtered water, and this resulted in some improvement.  I even added a pinch of salt to the grounds.  But it still seemed bitter to me. To justify my suspicions I decided to undergo a test of this machine against my Bunn.  I provided enough filtered water into both machines to produce 10 cups of coffee.  I then inserted a Maxwell House filter pod into the respective hoppers.  As I awaited the results the suspense was killing me. Result?  The Technivorm still produced coffee of a lesser quality than the Bunn.  Of course I could have stopped the brewing process in the Technivorm temporarily to terminate the water flow in order for the water to suspend longer in the coffee, as some users have suggested.  But, IMHO, life's too short for that. I included no additives to the coffee to contaminate the results. After this test I undertook a study of just how a drip grind coffee maker operates. It's basically just a simple process of pouring hot water over coffee placed in a filter over a carafe, cup, thermos or other receptacle. Isn't this process similar to the percolators of old?  Is it so different from just pouring hot water heated on a stove over the filter with the coffee?  Indeed, I had a fine cup of coffee prepared in just such a way in Germany several years ago. So why the fancy (and expensive) housings?  I suppose they are basically necessary to provide the convenience of an integrated water receptacle and heater.  And the integrated circuitry for the clocks, lights, and other operations were also required. Of course water temperature is one factor that can affect taste. Too hot and the coffee will burn; too cold and it will not provide a robust taste.  And coffee manufacturers can design temperature control into their products.  But is that the only variable factor that can be designed into the product? Well, I suppose the spray nozzle design could be a contributing factor to the end result, but that may be stretching it a little.  And there is a means of manually controlling the brewing process time, as mentioned earlier. So is that all there is to it?  Is that the only means by which companies can justify such prices for their products?  It appears so. The point here is as follows:  assuming two coffee makers produce coffee in exactly the same manner, with the same characteristics such as water temperature, coffee quality and measurement, etc., etc. then why should coffee produced in one machine taste differently than that in the other?  For that matter, why should the end product be an improvement over the method of heating water on a stove and pouring it into a filter filled with coffee grounds? I'm not sure.  All know that, in my opinion, coffee prepared with my Bunn tastes better than coffee prepared with my Technivorm.  I even enjoy re-heated leftover coffee with the Bunn (don't tell anybody). But the Technivorm design does have one advantage over my Bunn:  a permanent gold filter can be used to, presumably, produce a better taste.  The Bunn design requires a taller permanent filter than is available on the Market today. With the filters available now the basket will overflow if 10 cups of water are added to the reservoir of a Bunn.  But I don't mind.  I hate cleaning those permanent filters anyway. So I returned my Bunn to the kitchen and moved the Technivorm to the attic. I am now using the Bunn as my standard coffee maker.  I would welcome comments on how I can make the Technivorm more competitive.  I am not overjoyed about leaving such an expensive item to linger in my attic like that.",Basic Technology,Amazon,1

Plus you wonder if there is a difference. Well, there is. I've not only found this out to be true myself but I've asked 4 other people and they all said it was much better. OK, but is it worth it? Look, it depends on where you are in your coffee 'purity'. In my opinion the single biggest improvement you can make is to use a Burr grinder. I use this one: KitchenAid Pro Line Series Burr Coffee Mill, Onyx Black The second biggest improvement is filtered water. This would be the third. It makes a difference - it is better coffee. Remember that your largest expense in good coffee is the beans. This unit - in my opinion - pays for itself because every cup at home saves at least $1.50. I prefer my home brewed coffee. Because I prefer it I drink more coffee at home and not 'out'. Over the long run it all balances out. I hope this helps. UPDATE: OK, I've had this for a couple months now and I gotta say - BEST product in my house - it is a treat to have good coffee every day. I'm the type of person that believes that, if you are going to spend money, spend it on stuff you use every day. The coffee from this machine is just better - period. I've tried different beans and such and it is all - and always - better. It is very consistent - every day is good. So if this is your thing - don't hesitate - don't wait.

I had been using a Melita grind and brew for years but lately I was just plain disappointed with the coffee I was getting.  Melita finally died and I needed a replacement.

Coffee comes out at perfect temp.  No if's and's or butts. 3.  Carafe keeps coffee hot and love convenience of taking carafe to the table and sitting it next to me when I need a warm up or refill rather than going back to the counter.

What coffee should be in my opinion. As for complaints I've seen: 1.  Parts are 'cheap':  The parts are perfectly fine and I am confident will perform their function for years to come.  The machine is already expensive.  If you want some over-engineered carbon fiber components to perform simple tasks like a lid, you would pay even more and your coffee would taste the SAME. 2.  No Automation.  I'll sacrifice the whiz-bang electronics for amazing coffee any day.  This thing just works. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.

The machine looked very different from any other brewer I'd ever seen and it got my interest.  I wrote down the name of it and then went online to do a little research. I found that it was handmade in the Netherlands and that it was very pricey!!  I also read most of the reviews and 90% of them were extremely favorable.  I also learned that the correct brewing temperature of the water was one of the more important factors in making the perfect cup o' joe. I took the plunge...fast forward to FIVE YEARS later.  This coffeemaker is the best we've ever had.  I have to say to the few folks who had a bad experience with the build quality that, just like with any other product, some lemons do get through the assembly line.  We've used this once, twice, three times a day for five years and have never ever had a problem with it.  I read somewhere that you can expect 15 years of great service with it...or more...it is very well built! OK...how about the coffee??  FABULOUS!!  One of the best features of this coffeemaker is that you can tinker with the coffee as it's being brewed.  When I start the machine, I keep the lid of the grind basket off and move the metal brewing arm from side to side along with rotating the basket itself to make sure all of the grounds are getting dripped on first before I put the cover on and let it brew the rest of the way.  Some users report that they even take a wooden chop stick and stir the grounds/water for a while before letting it brew the rest of the way.  The is the ONLY machine I know of that lets you add a little of your own brewing expertise while you're making the coffee. The coffee is simply DELICIOUS!!!  You will spend more, but what you get in return is a GREAT cup of coffee, a well-built machine that will last for YEARS, and, a simple brewer with a LOT LESS to go wrong with it.  There is no timer to wear out or LED lights to burn out, no settings to fail; just turn it on and let it drip.  It's like that trusty stove top percolator from long ago...let the water heat, let it brew, drink.... One warning...always make sure the lever on the grounds basket is set to the 2-5 cup middle or 6-10 cup  top position.  If the lever is all the way down, the coffee will brew over...just make sure you check it since it can get moved with washing the basket.  Pretty simple.  Not to worry, if you brew and the lever just happens to be in the down or closed position (for use if you want to take a premature cup of coffee in the brewing process) the coffeemaker is designed so it won't spill over and make a mess; you'll just get a basket full of wet grounds and some of the coffee with LOTS of grounds in it in the carafe :-) In summation, I look forward every morning to waking up and brewing the best cup of coffee anyone will ever drink.  This machine is a simple marvel!!  Buy it; it will last you for years.  Oh, and don't forget to clean it with the powdered descaler recommended by the manufacturer.  Clean the machine at least once every couple of weeks.  It's easy and a must-do to keep your coffee tasting great. Hope you enjoy your Technivorm Moccamaster coffee!!

I must say that I am not sure what the negative reviewers were talking about.  I don't see anything cheap about the plastic; the little lid for the carafe to sit on isn't an issue; coffee is as hot as any machine I have ever had; and, it is attractive. I have had my maker for approximately one week now, and it is very functional and works as advertised.  It is very attractive on my counter, in a very sleek and somewhat minimalist way, fitting in well with the high end environment around it. The discussions about how hot the coffee gets and how long it stays hot in the carafe, was also a concern.  But after receiving it, I realized that we don't drink coffee except in the morning, and generally that is within two hours of waking up, so the carafe keeps it hot enough for us to get through a pot with no problem.  Heating the carafe is a good idea though, even though, for our purposes it really isn't necessary, just nice to have.  It does make the coffee a couple of degrees hotter. The taste of the coffee this machine makes is superb.  I have been buying all of this gourmet, high end coffee all of these years, and have never tasted what each batch really tasted like.  This maker brings out the flavors in the coffee beautifully, it is a pleasure in the mornings now to enjoy that first cup. Being a former 'Timer' coffee maker person, I did find it a little difficult to get up in the morning and have to go through the process I used to do at night before bed.  But, the taste of fresh ground coffee and the flavors this machine produces, have convinced me that I was pretty lazy all those years and missed out on the pleasure of having a great cup of coffee, for the convenience of a few minutes of time in the morning.  It will probably take some time to get fully into the 'no timer' mode, but I am enjoying the routine in the morning now, I feel more alive.

Even in the beginning I was after a good cup.  My father had a grinder and I learned early to manage the grind, and quantities to make a high quality, bold cup of coffee.  Over the years as money would allow I would research and purchase grinders and coffee makers with the goal of making the perfect cup. Each set up has had pros and cons, but all along I've made good coffee and improved my techniques.  Thermal carafes came along and improved coffee machines by eliminating the burning.  I found a burr grinder created the most consistent grind.  For the last 4 years, I've had a thermal carafe Cuisinart.  The bottom finally rusted to the point that it was marring the counter top and the brewing process sounded more like a popcorn machine than a coffee maker.  It was time for a replacement. After reading the reviews here, I paid my dues for membership.  I'm a proud owner for a month now.  I couldn't be more satisfied with the quality of the cup of coffee I drink now.  Here are a few of my observations. - The coffee is hot.  My Cuisinart would put out a cup of coffee at 155 F.  This cup showed at 177 F in a standard 8 oz mug right after brewing.  This is neither warming the carafe or the mug prior.  That makes for the perfect sipping temperature. - The operation is silent and fast.  I was used to the steaming and popping of my last machine signaling the end of the 12 minute brew cycle along with the loud beep.  This machine does neither.  From start to finish the cycle is 6 minutes. - There is no clock or timer.  No worries.  There is an easy workaround.  Although some coffee snobs consider this blasphemy, I like to set my coffee the night before so when I stumble groggy to the kitchen at 5:30 AM, it's done.  I bought a $9 lamp timer at Target, plugged the machine into that.  I set it to turn on at 5:30 AM.  I fill the water and grind the beans the night before then set the button to the ON position.  Works like a charm. I like that the water reservoir and the filter basket are in separate locations ensuring that there can never be and overflow of grounds or coffee into the water reservoir. Yes there are a few parts.  There are the separate water and filter basket covers and the two lids for the carafe (one for brewing and one for thermal storage).  Maybe more than a Mr. Coffee, but I find setup and clean up effortless. If you love coffee buy this machine.",If you love coffee stop wasting time and buy this machine!,Amazon,3

4108,Technivorm Moccamaster,"February 6, 2012","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,5,"UPDATE, years later, 12/13/2017:  I've lost track of how long I've owned this brewer, but I know it's somewhere between 7 and 10 years.  And, it's still going strong.  When you consider the cost of this coffee brewer, also consider that it's built to last.  I will admit that I needed to replace the filter basket once, about a year ago, because the stopper no longer stopped the dripping.  But, wow, this is a great machine.  Take good care of it by cleaning it with white vinegar every month or two, and it will reward you with great coffee for years. Here's the original review... Let's get something out of the way here...if you are going to buy coffee that was ground and packaged and has been sitting on your supermarket shelf since a couple weeks or months ago, you are most certainly wasting your money on this brewer.  There are a lot of good ways to make coffee, but all of these ways assume: 1. Your beans are freshly roasted (say, within the past week). 2. Your beans are recently ground (say, within the past couple minutes). There are a lot of other tips to preserving the quality of your coffee (choosing a roast that is not too dark, choosing coffee that has not been pre-flavored, storing your beans in an airtight container but not in the freezer, and so on).  Do a little research and you will find there are plenty of ways to improve your cup of coffee.  But don't spend a few hundred dollars on a coffee brewer if you don't like the idea of hunting down good freshly roasted beans, and grinding them yourself. But let's suppose you DO have some good beans available.  What do you do now?  Most automatic drip coffeemakers fail in that the water never gets hot enough (195-205 degrees Fahrenheit), and either brew too slowly or too quickly (about 5 or 6 minutes is about right...much shorter or much longer will result in coffee that is too weak or too bitter).  A tip: The National Coffee Association has a great website that talks about all of this. Enter the Technivorm brewer.  These are expensive, but have a reputation for consistently brewing coffee at the correct temperature and speed.  I've been using mine for the past couple years and it never fails to make a good pot of coffee.  The brewer is as simple to use as any drip coffee maker: pour water in the reservoir, put ground coffee in a filter, and turn it on.  Six minutes later, your coffee is ready.  This is really quite simple to use, and is low maintenance.  In fact, I find it easier to keep clean and maintain than the typical $25 brewer.  One other benefit of this brewer: the thermal carafe.  Letting freshly brewed coffee sit in a glass carafe on a burner is a bad idea...the burner quickly ruins a good pot of coffee.  This thermal carafe does a great job of keeping coffee hot, and eliminates the need for a burner. Are there less expensive ways to make good drip coffee? Absolutely.  Spend $30 on a Chemex brewer, for example.  Then, it's up to you to heat your own water to the right temperature, and pour it yourself over the ground coffee at the proper rate.  I've done this, and it works well because I have total control over the process.  The Technivorm simply automates this process.  That is, after all, the idea behind an 'automatic' coffee maker. A couple notes: First, as with any drip coffee maker, it should be cleaned once in a while to keep it running well (I run white vinegar through mine once every couple months, followed by a few pots of water to eliminate the vinegar residue).  Second, I like using one of those 'gold' permanent filters.  However, the one I have doesn't work well for me.  Maybe the problem is with the filter, but it doesn't seem to release the water quickly enough, causing a backup that puts grounds in my cup of coffee. I'm probably rambling a bit here, so let me wrap this up.  If you are someone who is willing to seek out quality coffee beans, and you care about the details that go into a proper cup of coffee, but don't want to stand over a Chemex brewer pouring water every monring, then this is absolutely worth the price.  It will provide you with well brewed coffee for years!",No better way to make drip coffee,Amazon,2

4110,Technivorm Moccamaster,"February 4, 2012","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,5,"DESIGN PRIORITIES: As of this writing, this appears to be the only home brewer that heats water to the proper brew temperature of 198-205°F as recommended by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. Below is a summary of my thoughts after 6 months with the machine, including a summary of what I have learned about brewing coffee properly, and how it relates to the design priorities of this brewer: LESS IS MORE: This brewer is not fancy. It doesn't have a computer, there's no built-in grinder, and that's just why I like it. It's got only what matters, and what it's got works well. It won't overflow onto the countertop even if the basket is plugged, it cleans up easily, and makes great tasting coffee. I think of this brewer as the easiest way to get French press quality every morning. THE KEY TO GOOD COFFEE IS THE BREW TEMPERATURE, AND THE APPROPRIATE PARTICLE SIZE: Higher brewing temperature (up to about 205°F) results in faster extraction from  coffee particles. Larger coffee particles result in slower extraction. If the water temperature is too low for a given brew time and/or particle size, the coffee will be under-extracted, resulting in a bland flavor profile. If the brew time is too great and/or the particle size is too fine for a given temperature, the coffee will be over-extracted, resulting in unnecessary bitterness. ONLY THE OPTIMAL EXTRACTION TEMPERATURE CAN CREATE THE OPTIMAL COFFEE EXTRACTION: Think of it like this: Extraction speeds up as temperature increases, BUT the extraction of desirable flavors from the coffee SPEEDS UP FASTER in response to the ideal extraction temperature than the undesirable bitter flavors do. Therefore the OPTIMAL extraction (the highest ratio of desirable flavors to bitter flavors) can ONLY occur at the ideal temperature. BREW AT THE IDEAL TEMPERATURE AND ADJUST THE PARTICLE SIZE TO MATCH: At least one reviewer wrote that he/she was getting more bitterness with this machine.  That happened to me initially as well.  The higher 'ideal' brew temperature will OVER-EXTRACT coffee that is ground as finely as is customary for common home drip brewers (which brew at around 170-185°F).  The same would have happend those grounds had been brewed in a french press.  Particle size in a PROPER drip brewer with ideal extraction time and temperature (such as this one) must be LARGER.  When I changed my grind to be like that of a French press, the coffee started tasting like it came from a French press. COST: The machine may seem expensive $299, but consider the irony that every other home coffee brewer available falls short of its primary objective of making coffee per the recommendations of the coffee industry's very own experts.  I can't help but think this consistent failure is due in part to market forces. Consumers may be led to believe that this machine is expensive because store shelves are 'littered' with multitudes of 'nice' drip brewers that cost right around $100. Naturally, it costs MORE to design and manufacture a drip coffee machine that consistently performs properly and precisely. Now that I've had time to consider this machine's components and performance, it no longer seems expensive or even 'extravagant'. I don't mean to suggest that everyone needs to spend $300 on this brewer. Certainly the $100 brewers are good enough to 'get the job done' for many people, but if you are someone who enjoys the pursuit of excellent Coffee, you may need to re-calibrate your expectations of what it costs to make a machine that actually does what it was designed to do.  Think of it as an investment in a good tool.  Good tools have always been 'expensive' but very rarely do they turn out to be a bad value. ROUND OR SQUARE: Should you buy the 'round' MoccaMaster CD Thermo (CDT) or the 'square' KBT-741? Fundamentally they're exactly the same brewer.  While I slightly prefer the aesthetics of the CDT, I also find the function to be slightly better in the following ways: 1. The water tank lid on the CDT is bit easier to grasp than the rectangular lid on the KBT series.  You can grab the round lid equally well with either hand, whereas I found the rectangular lid hard to grasp 'the long way'.  The CDT lid also seems to 'fall into place', where the KBT lid requires more precise placement. 2. The round shape of the lid also allows the 'spout' to be positioned anywhere anywhere over the basket and the lid rotates freely to accomodate. The square lid of the KBT-741 can not rotate, so it has been designed with a partially open 'slot' to allow some re-positioning. Functionally they achieve the same end, but round version is a simpler, better, cleaner solution to the same problem. 3. The cover for the CDT's brew basket is slightly easier to grasp because it has a taller 'lip' for your thumb and forefinger. This tends to keep your fingers further from the hot spout should you ever need to lift the cover of the brew basket while brewing. 4. The 'shelf' that holds the brew basket on the CDT feels just a little more sturdy.  It's not a big difference, but all else being equal it feels like better fit and finish.  It's probably because of the natural 'beam strength' of the curved aluminum body of the CDT brewer where it attaches.  The very same material of the very same thickness will be less rigid when it has a flat shape, such as on the KBT.  Again, I'm splitting hairs. TWEAKS (UPDATED): If I were to make ONE design change to this product line, I MIGHT make the rubber feet about 3mm 'taller', or make the thermal stopper about 3mm shorter.  This would allow the thermal carafe to fit back under the brew basket even with the thermal stopper in place.  Currently it doesn't quite fit.  A Technivorm rep told me that the large stopper was NOT intended to fit under the brew basket, rather it is only intended to be used if you happen to be traveling with your carafe.  Instead Technivorm recommends using the mixing tube/cap that comes with the machine on a day to day basis.  I was doubtful that it would have equivalent thermal retention properties as the stopper, but I can now attest that it performs equally well. As an added benefit, the mixing tube/cap also makes the carafe 'pour' with perfect predictability (an improvement over pouring with the stopper in place). Before this realization, I had made a minor tweak to my machine by 'shimming' the feet with 3mm worth of folded paper.  I slid the rubber feet out of their little slots, inserted my tiny paper shims, and slid the feet right back into place. Now the machine sits about 3mm taller, and the carafe fits perfectly with the travel stopper in place, though it's largely irrelevant because I never use the stopper now.","If brew quality is your priority, this is your brewer.",Amazon,31

Several have made quite good coffee, but always with some aggravating 'Yes, but'. This one, in spite of the hefty price tag has its shortcomings. I have used a good quality conical burr grinder with all my drip machines, so that is not a variable. The Technivorm likely makes the best coffee - when you are at the excellent end of the scale, it is hard for me to say for certain. Suffice it to say the Technivorm is about as good as it gets, for drip coffee. But... the thermal carafe just is back toward the lower end products. I pre-heat it of course, and the coffee is great if you pour right away, but later the second cup is aggravatingly cooler, even using the travel lid. The best thermal carafe that I have found is the Cuisinart which came with the Cuisinart 12 cup drip machine. The Cuisinart machine, by the way, is a run-over nightmare requiring you to stand over it watching the brew closely. The Technivorm on the other hand has a much better designed drip basket which is adjustable for the particular brew. It is still possible to run it over, but you have to work at it, and the consequences are light (doesn't get all over the counter and run on the floor, as the Cuisinart does). So - what I am doing is making coffee in the Technivorm and immediately transferring it to the Cuisinart carafe. You could also transfer to any trusted good thermal carafe or thermos. This makes the Technivorm overpriced in my view, but if you are willing to suffer the poor thermal carafe, or consume the coffee quickly, it does make excellent coffee.

4127,Technivorm Moccamaster,"October 10, 2011","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,5,"Even after reading all of the reviews provided here, I was still surprised at how cheaply this product appears to be made. After having my Capresso TEC for several years (which cost $200), I know what a durable plastic coffeemaker looks and feels like. The TV appears to be brittle plastic and I believe if either the reservoir or filter lids are dropped they could easily break. I've seen complaints about the thermal carafe saying that it does not pour well. Not true. At first glance it does look as though there may be a problem since there's no dimple/lip to pour, however it pours nicely with no drips or spills what-so-ever. You only need turn the cap 1/4 of turn to pour. It does not pour fast. You can remove the cap to pour but every time you do that, you lose heat, so don't defeat the purpose of the lid to keep in the heat. This carafe keeps the coffee hot. The really big flaw is that you have to switch from the brew-thru lid to the cap immediately when the brewing has completed in order to preserve heat. I hope this carafe will be as durable as the carafe on my previous Capresso, but it doesn't appear as well made. Time will tell. I see that a replacement carafe is available if need be, for $80. (Replacement carafe for the Capresso TEC was $60) I like to have 2 carafes for when I have company. I realize, as others have said, that if you're really into coffee, that you won't care about the absence of extra features because for the best coffee you should grind the beans, brew and drink immediately. I agree, but sometimes I'd like to have the option of setting the timer and having it waiting for me all nice and hot when I wake up, like I did sometimes with my Capresso. The other feature on the Capresso that I loved was the removable water reservoir that was so easy to fill. This coffeemaker does make great coffee and the most important things I care about, 1 )brewing at 203 degrees, and 2) thermal carafe that keeps coffee hot, are there so I'm happy with it. I suppose you've figured out by now that if the Capresso TEC was still available I'd purchase another, because it brewed a fantastic HOT cup of coffee - just as good as this for 100 dollars less. Unfortunately, the other Capresso models did not do as well, so don't try them. There is no truth to the claim by others that the plastic plate that the carafe sits on falls off all the time. It most certainly does not, when it's properly attached. It is one of the features though, that seems flimsy and adds to the perception that this is a cheaply made product. When making six cups or less I do restrict the flow to the second setting on the filter basket switch. I think $300 is crazy for this coffeemaker, but I did try others and this worked best. Update: I've changed my mind. I would NOT purchase my  old Capresso again if I had the option. After using this for a month I LOVE it!! I don't need any other features. It's GREAT!! Update - Feb 7, 2015 ~ Three and a half years later and my Technivorm is still going strong. All of the parts are intact and I do know where I can get replacement parts if I need them. I would still like a brew-thru lid that would close when brewing is complete like on my old Capresso, but other than than, this is my all time FAVE coffee brewer.",I'm happy with it !,Amazon,11

Pros: makes great coffee, fast. The design gives you a lot of control over how your coffee is brewed. Seems to be a quality build so it should last a while with proper care. The insulated carafe is excellent and keeps my coffee hot for a long time. Cons: cost, obviously. Also, the spray arm (the one with the 9 holes in the end) doesn't seem to distribute the hot water over the bed of grounds very well. To fix this, I use a spoon to make sure all of the grounds start out evenly wet. There are no automatic features--this means that when the water is done you need to turn a switch off to shut off the heating mechanism. Overall: probably the best drip-style coffee maker you can buy right now. Update Feb 2015: This coffee maker is still going strong. Not only that, but this company stands behind their product. My carafe happened to lose its insulating properties after a move and we emailed the company to ask if there was anything they could do.

I love that I can see the reservoir itself as I pour in water and don't have to rely on a water indicator. Best of all, the flow through cover has a true hole to  accept coffee flow. My old capresso had a mechanism by which coffee drained into the pot past a small bead that occasionally got stuck and left me with a flood.. That was the reason i didn't stick with capresso which does have terrific customer service. Coffee from the technivorm  stays wicked hot in the thermal carafe despite the hole in the cover. I think it is very expensive, but if this  lasts as long as my capresso did (10 years) I will be happy. I do like working with this much better.

Boy did I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this coffee maker.  The coffee isn't as acidic and has a more crisp taste.  As many reviewers have mentioned, the carafe sucks.  I don't have a problem pouring like some, but it just doesn't keep it hot.  If you wait more than 10 minutes after brewing to pour your cup then it's cool.  The funnel thing that comes with it does improve this shortcoming, but don't expect to leave it for an hour and still be scalding hot.  On the up side, it brews really quickly and almost before you turn around, it's done.  The problem with no automatic ability to make it stop dripping when the pot is removed isn't a big one since it brews so fast.  So, is it worth the money?  I think so.  I would buy it again despite it's shortcomings.

In order to make the brew time around the 6 minute ideal, I have to stop the drip and allow the plastic cup to fill up with coffee and let it sit.  There's probably no way to brew two cups at a time, because the plastic cup wouldn't hold it, and the brew time would be too short if I allowed it to drip through without a waiting period.  So realistically, I can make one cup or eight. The spigot that dispenses the water apparently isn't stainless steel, because it has rusted on the bottom.  And the little plastic footer that the carafe sits on isn't attached to the unit in a very reliable manner and comes off easily; I consider it pretty much useless.  I'd expect better for the price of the unit. On a positive note, the brew temperature is dead on, which is why I bought the device.

For years, we used a Starbucks coffee maker.  It's still going strong, so we gave it to my son for college.  After reading all the reviews I measured the temperature in the Starbucks just after brewing and sure enough, it was only 162 F.  Yes, it's true, there are no bells and whistles on this thing, but after you brew your first cup of coffee, you won't care.  This is our second day of using it.  We are fortunate in the fact that I have 2 kids that work for Starbucks.  I have not paid for coffee beans in years, so why not splurge a little on the equipment?  We are using the Gold filter you can purchase on Amazon with the coffee maker.  We had to play around with number of scoops and our taste.  I was contemplating the burr grinder, but my son explained to me that Starbucks beans are roasted already.  The blade grinder is not going to roast them much more.  He's a barista, what do I know?  We use a cheap Cuisinart Blade Grinder and it's fine. This thing is simply the best drip coffee maker you can buy.  The three reasons I purchased it are:  1.  Temperature (202)  2. Copper Core  3. Made in Holland!  We are of Dutch descent, so that was a plus for us.  It brews a full pot in 6 minutes or less.  I am happy to make it in the morning fresh - it takes no time at all.  The brewing is virtually silent.  I'm sure other owners can relate to this.  You watch it with fascination during the first brew!  The only thing you will hear in the morning is me grinding the beans for 30 seconds.  I have figured out that 7 scoops of coffee (Starbucks ground not too fine) with water up to the 10 mark is perfect for me. Unlike some reviews, I have had zero problems with leaking.  How hard is it to understand the 3 settings on the filter?  Watch a couple of videos before you buy it.  The features are all there to make a perfect cup of coffee and not spill one drop.  This thing takes half the space of the old one and I think it looks amazing. Take my advice, don't over analyze it like I did.  Simply, buy this thing, watch a video on how to use it, and enjoy a perfectly brewed cup of coffee with a hand made coffee maker.  It's made in Holland and does what it says - brews a perfect cup of coffee.  If you think 300 bucks is too much, think about this:  How often can you purchase something that does what it says and is HAND MADE?  You're not paying 300 bucks for some piece of junk made in China!  If you read all the reviews, you'll notice that everyone agrees with one thing - this thing makes a good cup of coffee, if not a perfect cup of coffee.

4134,Technivorm Moccamaster,"August 11, 2011","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,5,"After weeks of searching and reading reviews, I opted to buy the expensive Technivorm Moccamaster Coffee Brewer - and I'm not dissapointed. I wanted a coffee maker that brewed quickly, made great coffee and was easy to clean.  Some of the other brands met 2 out of 3 of my criteria, but this was the only one that met them all.  The thermo carafe was a bonus and now I don't know how I did without one. Brews quickly - I didn't care about having a timer.  I fill my coffee maker the night before and then turn it on in the morning.  I close the filter for about 30 seconds so that the water starts filling the coffee in the filter and then I open it either half or all the way.  Within a minuute or so, I close the filter again and pour myself the first cup of coffee.  With my old Mr. Coffee, even though it had the brew and stop, I had to heat that first cup in the microwave.  I don't have to do that anymore, thank goodness. Makes great coffee - I followed the instructions, using their scoop and my home-ground coffee.  I also use bottled spring water since our water is hard and full of minerals.  Since I use bottled water, it is easy to pour into the machine to the level of the number of cups of coffee I want.  Their 8 cup mark is not the same as my 8 cups since I use large coffee cups, but I think that is the same with all coffee makers.  The finished coffee tastes great, very smooth and with a bold flavor.  I know that the kind of coffee you use makes a big difference, but I'm using the same coffee I have always used - and it tastes much better for some reason.  I also like having the thermo carafe.  The instructions say to pour hot water to heat it up before you use it.  Most of the time, I don't do that and the coffee is still plenty hot for me.  I also love being able to drink an hour later and have it still be hot - and taste great.  No more burned coffee. Some people have wanted an automatic shut-off, but this coffee pot is made to be basic, and so hopefully last a long time.  When the coffee is finished brewing, I turn off the machine, and screw on the carafe lid - which I keep on top of the coffee pot while it's brewing.  I also remove the plastic base so that the pot with the lid fits under the filter.  The only reason I can see for that base is to keep the thermos from possibly marking up the counter.  It's simple to put in place, so I use it. Easy to clean - the only parts that really need cleaning are the filter and the carafe.  Both clean up easily with soap and water.  I haven't put them in my dishwasher because they only take a minute to clean. I'm going to sound a bit obsessed but I have actually been looking forward to my morning coffee!  I want to invite neighbors over to have coffee with me.  Maybe the newness will wear off soon, but for now, I can't wait to get up in the morning! Update 11-13. I am using this coffee maker regularly and still love it.  I really like that you can turn off the filter area and pour coffee while it is still brewing.  I do sometimes forget to turn off the coffee maker for a few hours but it hasn't caused any problem. This was an expensive purchase but it seems to be well made.",Better Than I Expected,Amazon,4

Then again it goes against what Technivorm has done here... Fresh beans each morning, fresh water, and a great pot of coffee.... One last thing, before I bought this machine I read tons of reviews on coffee makers and my one concern was the BPA question.

I can however speak to a few common complaints I've read on this site and other review sites that seem to have been addressed. First, the unit is packaged well, almost full assembled, only needing the brew basket and carafe installed. I had it set up in less than 2 minutes once I had the package open. Overall construction seems to be well thought out, clearly a step above the Bunn line that I have used for so long (10+ years). One off the primary reasons I bought this unit is that it seems to be far more 'serviceable' than any other coffee machine I could find. This is important because I'd rather keep the machine as long as possible, and this certainly helps. It's been my experience that high quality, simple, purpose-designed tools often last the longest, and this seems to fit the bill. Common complaints I had read previous to the purchase included the carafe height, the carafe's ability to keep the coffee warm, no timer, design of the brew head... etc.. The carafe now fits under the brew basket with both lids attached. So, after brewing into the brew-thru lid, you can transfer over to the traditional carafe lid, which helps to keep the coffee hot. After receiving the unit, I brewed a pot of coffee, drank a cup, and sealed the carafe before bed (about 10pm). I woke at 6:30am and the coffee was still warm. Not hot enough for me to drink, but perhaps warm enough for my wife (who prefers her coffee much cooler). Since then, I've been able to rely on the carafe to keep coffee hot enough to drink (I like coffee very hot) for about 5 hours. I've had no problems pouring from the carafe without spilling coffee. The brew basket has 3 flow settings, for full flow, 1/2 flow and no flow. This is much more handy than I first expected, as you can close the brew basket immediately after brewing is complete, and not worry about dripping coffee all over your kitchen counters. I also use the 'no flow' setting to allow the coffee to steep a little immediately after starting the machine (mostly because of the brew-head design). The brew-head is improved upon from the past one-hole designs. There is now a 9-hole brew-head on the machine, which really helps to disperse the hot water over a larger area of coffee. However, it still doesn't near full saturation over the surface of the grounds, and requires a little hand holding to get full saturation. Fortunately, the brew-head arm swivels freely, and allows for manual dispersion of the water. This is not a problem for me, because I grind beans anyway, and it really only takes about 1 minute to ensure the grounds are steeped properly before switching to full flow. I had a few pots my wife made without babysitting the grounds and they tasted excellent as well. Bottom line, if you can get past the purchase price, you'll receive a machine that makes great coffee, is easy to use, and seems to be built for the long haul. If this lasts even 5 years, it will be a cheaper machine than the Bunn's have been for my family.",Overall impressions of the Technivorm,Amazon,10

To wit: The coffee this thing produces is amazing. It is really worth the price. But: There are some odd quirks to this product. Not enough to make me regret the purchase though. To elaborate: It is kind of a clunky design and for the price you would not expect it to look quite this 'cheap'. The piece under the carafe is annoying because it doesn't seem to serve any purpose. It comes off easily, which can be a problem because if you don't fully 'snug in' the carafe it won't brew your coffee. When the plastic piece gets jostled slightly out of position (without my knowing it) that means I have to wait extra long for my coffee. The brew basket has a selector to allow it to be plugged, I imagine the idea is since the coffee is so good, you will not possibly be able to wait for the brewing to finish before you drink your first mugful, so you can shut it off, remove the carafe for a short time, and then put it back to continue the brewing. However, the toggle for this is pretty easy to flip mistakenly, so I have on more than one occasion found a mess of grounds and overflowed coffee on my counter from having left it on for the entire cycle. You just need to be really careful with that switch. However, like basically everyone else, I am still giving it 5* because the coffee is so incredibly good.",The best coffee you'll ever brew at home!,Amazon,22

Well fans believe it, It is true! the coffee does taste better just because of the maker. First the unit is beautiful, well built with quality products. No fancy unneccessary buttons or timers or filters (I use bottled spring water anyway). The water is hotter than the coffee I get from Starbucks, remember heat the thermos first. The coffee stays hot with the cap on for 2-3 hours I tested it on Saturday the steam lasted for hours and the coffee stayed hot. You have to be careful on that first sip or you may burn your mouth. I Finally found the Grail of Coffee makers and this is it! I spent the Fall in Rome, Italy staying at the 5 star Hassler Hotel off of the Spanish Steps and the coffee form this maker reminded me of the very fine coffee I had there.

So I hope Amazon doesn't mind if I use his name.  I thought it would be nice to get a really fancy coffee pot/maker because we were doing really well and the mortgage, we didn't know about the balloon thing, or Sid said we could flip the house (he stays up and watches infomercials and gets all these ideas about flipping and ballooning).  So I saw that this coffee maker/pot was just about the most expensive one around, and I figured people must be willing to pay a lot of money for it like it was for a Lincoln or going to Macy's.  And I wanted to surprise him.  So I looked for Techno Worm, because Cindy said that was probably the Hollandaise name, but after looking around I found this one.  Of course Cindy was being a wise guy saying Hollandaise, but it was from Holland.  And when Sid opened it he looked kind of gray, except that was because he hadn't been flipping too good and the ballooning was starting.  And he had a tantrum.  But he settled down when I pulled out the Folgers and the Mr. Coffee filter papers (which don't work in this pot/maker, you need the other ones). It sure does make a lot of water all over the counter if you don't put the little bar just right, and Cindy was laughing and not helping, just like she hadn't flunked out of community college and wasn't going to have a baby.  At home.  But when we got it hooked up right and the bar was working, boy did it come out fast.  The water, I mean.  And this skimpy little plastic filter thing has a lever or something with circles that don't really explain it, so we got more stuff (brown this time) all over the counter.  But three's a charm, like they say, and finally we got the coffee in the pot and into Sid, who was actually worried about wasting the Folgers.  But he said it was weak, but then he saw that it hurt my feelings, so he said it wasn't that weak, but it sure didn't seem to get all the coffee wet so maybe I could use a little less next time?

With the increase in brewing temperature, I immediately noticed a change in the flavor, and it took a few weeks to decide that I preferred it.  The Technivorm requires a bit less grounds, about 25%, so that took some adjusting as well.  After one year of using the machine, I still love it.  Not as fast as the Bunn of course, but it produces a flavor I find not at all ostentatious, a bit flirty, but with a sense of its own self.

Granted the coffee is 'hot' when it is brewed - it doesn't stay that way even following directions to preheat the carafe before brewing and in a short time the quality of the coffee breaks down to 'not all that good'.   My experince was very disappointing.  The coffee temp is initially quite good, not great, and I'm not sure it ever reached the temperatire advertised.  The Karafe is a serious weak link.  The 'thermal properties' are severely lacking since after about an hour the coffee is either slightly warm or just room temperature.  The attached apparatus to the polished steel body are junk plastic--especially the brewing funnel.  Now, as a not-so-slight annoyance, be aware that after a pot is brewed with the flow-throughcap, one must immediately remove and replace with the closed cap.  Even when this latter procedure is followed religiously, the coffee will not stay warm due to the poor karafe design.  Come on!  For 300 bucks, I would expect a decent glass lined, double wall insulated karafe!  The only reason this gets three stars is to give credit to the copper heating element. I once spent $350 for a Bosche/Porsche coffee maker and it still works after 6 years--with more convenient and usuable features.

They seem to fall into 'no coffee maker should cost this much,' or 'it's not made of platinum.' In either case, my advice is this: don't buy it! For those interested in a review of the thing itself, so you can decide if it's worth the (high) price here it is. My wife and I like coffee. It's one of the day's regular pleasures and we drink coffee every day. So we think our regular use justifies some extravagance. We buy good coffee. For years we used a small plastic Krupps grinder and a Krupps then Cusineart coffee maker. And it was fine. But then I took a flier on a burr grinder--way more expensive than the Krupps grinder (c. $100 vs $25 or so). And it was a revelation!!  So then, with some Christmas money in hand we did research and were persuaded by a Cooks' Illustrated review and bought the Technivorm. Wow! My idea of coffee is entirely changed. I get all that stuff about 'notes of chocolate,' and all that. It is just terrific coffee. What excellent wine is to table wine (and we drink a lot of table wine; so this is not about snobbism). The whole Technivorm schtick is simple: a good pump, and keep the coffee at c. 200F until it comes out the nozzle over the coffee. Who would think it would make such a difference? But it does. The machine itself is perfectly durable, but it's not fancy and is largely plastic, not metal. Whatever. The thermos keeps the coffee hot (if, as the instructions suggest, you rinse it first with hot water) for at least 5 hours. After that you should make a new pot anyway. It is fast, and it is quiet. It makes 10.5 cups, which is a little less than we'd like when company comes (12 is good). The question is, and it's a real question--is this indulgence the way you want to spend your money? And of course, its durability is unproven--we've only had it for a month.  But it makes wonderful coffee. If that's really important to you, and you've got the money, then this machine won't disappoint you. ===== A couple of years later: The TV is still going strong, still making wonderful coffee. It has slowed a bit despite occasional white-vinegar treatments. Most notable: the carafe has colored on the inside and has a sort of brown glaze on the bottom.

I sit here now drinking coffee that tastes as great as the first day it arrived. The best thing about this machine is that it makes hot coffee -- but not so hot that I scald myself (unless I brew it directly into a thermal mug and then drink it right away). The next best thing is that every piece that comes into contact with the coffee is EASILY WASHABLE, in particular, the drip arm that releases the hot water into the filter basket. You never have to spend your time with a toothbrush trying desperately to get the bitter grounds or sediment off the inside of a coffee machine because you just remove the arm and throw it in the dishwasher. I have the older model that didn't have a flow through lid for brewing, so I can't speak to that. It wasn't a huge issue for me because allowing the coffee to flow directly into the carafe cools it to the temperature I like. The carafe itself, however, was ridiculous in shape and lost its thermal seal after a year, just out of warranty. I replaced it with a Nissan thermal carafe. I would downgrade the coffeemaker for the unreliable carafe, but the coffee itself is so consistent after three years that I still give it 5 stars. Also, the filter basket has a little shutoff valve that should stop it from dripping after you remove the carafe. The valve can also be partially closed to slow the flow of water through the coffee grounds, should you like stronger coffee or be brewing half a pot. After several months of use, the valve will fail to prevent all leakage. I know this because I own two of them. I bought an extra one.  I don't know whether Technivorm has addressed this problem. HOWEVER, the filter basket has another nifty feature that makes me willing to endure some drips -- It has overflow slits in it that prevent those awful coffee maker disasters from clogged filters. You know, when you return to your filter coffee maker to find a huge coffee explosion because the coffee was too fine or the filter folded over on itself?  I have never had a single coffee filter disaster in three years. None. Nada. Zip. Some people complain about the other plastic pieces being flimsy, but they are still looking great after three years in the dishwasher, despite the manual's advice to hand wash them.

Afterwards there was the Silex, the Chemex, the French Press and finally the contemporary electric coffee maker.  Having lived through this evolution, I finally have found the perfect machine, the Technivorm Moccamaster and the perfect cup of morning coffee. If one keeps their eye on the prize, that wonderful cup of Joe in the AM, this machine with its quality construction, engineering and simplicity is the ONLY coffee maker to consider. I read so many unfavorable reviews pointing out flimsy construction, over-flowing, dangerous polycarbonates, lack of automation, outrageous price,  luke-warm coffee, etc., that I initially became hesitant.  But after another spill of water onto the counter instead of into the Cuisinart, getting the kitchen magnifying glass to check the miniscule readout and ultimately average coffee, I decided to take the plunge.  Each morning after the first sip, I thank myself for doing so. The Technivorm Moccamaster is sturdy and hefty.  There is no reason, for example, for the cover over the nozzle to be built like a tank unless you tend to brutalize your kitchen appliances each day.  I've used the Moccamaster for about two months now without a single overflow...just make sure you use common care and open the valve of the coffee basket.  No leeching polycarbonates are used in the 'plastic' parts. We grind our coffee and pour in the water the night before without any loss of quality.  I come down in the morning, pour hot water from the faucet to pre-heat the carafe, dump it after 30 seconds, place the carafe into position and press a button.  By the time I take the coffee mugs off the shelf and place them onto the table, get the milk for my wife out of the fridge, etc., the coffee is ready.  The heating unit is so huge in this machine that 10 cups of coffee are made in six minutes.  Also, the coffee remains hot in the carafe as long as you pre-heat it, as all thermal carafes require. If one wants total automation and mediocre coffee, buy one of the many poorly human-engineered makers that flood the market.

Should the switch be in the stopped position, the TV basket will overflow creating a huge mess. 3.  Speaking of the flow control switch, the off position doesn't really work very well.

Back when I was in my teens, I noticed how different coffee tasted from what my mother made and what delicious coffee came from my grandmother's old aluminum drip pot.  She would boil the water and pour it into the top of the aluminum chamber and it would drip through the middle section which had a series of tiny holes evenly across the coffee basket.  And in about 6 or 7 minutes, the most wonderful coffee filled the 8 cup pot.  Well now it all makes sense.  The SCAA says the perfect brew method to not over or under extract the coffee oils is 195 to 205 degree water that stays in contact with correctly and recently ground coffee for 6 minutes.  Of course, the 212 degree water in Granny's pot cooled quickly in the aluminum pot and pretty much followed the formula listed by SCAA. Well, the Technivorm hits the formula perfectly, is VERY well constructed with a heavy electrical cord to power the massive heating element. Water comes up the heating tube at about 208 degrees and cools to about 195 as it drips from the end of the delivery tube above the brew basket.  It draws about 10.5 amps and pulls the line current from 120 volt to about 117 at my house.  But the bottom line - this pot makes an excellent cup of coffee and the thermal carafe keeps it hot for as long as the coffee is drinkable although I do always preheat the carafe before I use it. I love the European design and it makes 10 European cups of coffee (5 ounce).  I use 57 grams of coffee at a medium course grind to make what I consider to be the perfect cup.  It's a bit pricey, for sure, but that's because Technivorm doesn't cut any corners.

It operates very quietly.  It doesn't have the ubiquitous digital clock found on most other appliances; it also doesn't have a timer mechanism to automatically start up in the morning for those who like to maximize their sleep. Upon assembly you will note that there are five lightweight plastic parts that, when placed into operation, sit loosely on the unit: two carafe plugs (one for operation; one for carafe serving); a filter holder; a filter cover; and, a cold water reservoir cover.  All are well designed, needed, and add to the total coffee preparation time. The KBT-741 does not have a warming plate (for those who tolerate coffee over seven minutes old).  Temperature retention is addressed by pre-warming the carafe with hot water. The unit takes approximately 6 to 7 minutes to percolate coffee.  However, if you are willing to spend roughly $300 for a coffee percolator you will also want to use freshly ground coffee to maximize the experience.  Changing whole beans in a bag to coffee grounds in the filter adds another 5 minutes to the process.  If you like good coffee, it may be worth the 10 to 12 minute total wait. The filter holder has a flow delay/shut-off mechanism.  Since most of us are anxious to get their first cup of coffee (and don't want to clean-up post-prep filter drip), you invariably switch the flow control switch to the 'off' position.  The problem is to remember to switch the flow back 'on' before reuse.  One filter mechanism overflow event usually provides the necessary operational training. Also note that the KBT-741 is of Dutch design and rated to smaller-sized European serving tastes (10 cups).  This unit only makes seven standard sized 6 oz. servings.  What this means is that you will most likely have to make multiple preparations for groups of four or more coffee drinkers in the States.

Here's the however: I got rid of all my water bottles, and all my food containers, made out of polycarbonate plastic. The clear, hard, plastic that the reservoir seems to be made of. Polycarbonate leaches the endocrine disrupting chemical BPA into the food and liquid it contains. In April 2008, Health Canada assessed that the chemical may pose some risk to infants and proposed classifying the chemical as ''toxic' to human health and the environment' (from [...]), all US manufacturers are curtailing use in food contact items, it's not used in baby bottles anymore. (From what I've read, there may be exceptions.) The European Union is backtracking (as is the US FDA) on statements that it's safe. The Netherlands, where Technivorn is located, considers it 'safe' ([...]) So, why pay $265+++ for a coffee maker that exposes one to BPA? Really, for that price the materials should be of the highest quality. I'd rather risk broken glass if it has to be clear, or simply a safe, opaque plastic. I plan on writing to Technivorm to request more information and possibly a glass replacement reservoir, but wanted to give prospective buyers a heads-up.

4196,Technivorm Moccamaster,"December 28, 2009","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,5,"I love coffee.  For the past year, I've been immersed in the technical and chemical artistry (and it truly is) of home roasting my own coffee and perfecting the brewing process to take advantage of total control and total freshness.  Up to now, I've made my single cups using a thermostatically controlled water kettle and a cone drip device which allows me to control the 'steep' time of the water at the proper temperature.  But what to do when guests come over? The overwhelming consensus is that the TechniVorm (TV) is the Rolls Royce of batch coffee makers.  I got one as a gift and I agree. We all know that cheap coffee makers cannot supply brewing temperature water at the desired 203F.  My Mr. Coffee, for example, was 169F at the brewhead.  More on this in a minute. The coffee maker comes assembled and requires only that the brewhead wand, filter basket and covers be installed.  The water chamber is clear plastic with cup level markings on the side.  I have not measured the 'cup' volumes yet but I suspect they are consistent with a 6 oz. cup size.  The coffee measure with the TV is said to make two cups per scoop, which is fairly accurate as a starting point.  The filter basket, basket cover and water chamber cover are black plastic.  The brewhead wand is stainless steel. The TV is simple enough to use.  Placing the filter basket on a plastic support is a no-brainer except that it helps to notice that the handle should go in front facing you, not to either side.  This is because the basket is wedge shaped at the bottom to accommodate the #4 cone filters used, and the brewhead wand is designed to distribute water along the length of the bottom wedge.  There are nine holes in the brewhead which distribute water effectively onto the coffee. Taking a closer look at the TV, it is obvious that one of the reasons it achieves the proper high brewing temperature is that the siphon from the heating chamber passes through an outer plastic tube which effectively insulates the heated water from the cold unheated water in the water chamber.  This is the main design flaw with cheaper coffee makers.  The TV also has two heating coils rather than one to help maintain a high enough water temperature. Additional control is provided with a three-position switch on the side of the filter basket.  The positions are full flow (although the hole is quite small), partial flow and closed.  My brewing so far has been to leave the switch open, as I'm brewing 10-cup batches and use a rather fine grind which extends the drip time.  I have not yet made 2-cup batches, but I will plan to close the switch completely to enable a 4-minute steep time before releasing the coffee into the carafe.  Note that the grind is a major variable here since fine grind will slow the water considerably over a coarser grind.  I use a burr grinder which can be controlled easily.  If you use a blade grinder, plan on a very fine grind and longer brew times. Since I use home roasted coffee, my coffee is extremely fresh after a customary 4-day rest period.  Very fresh coffee will give off CO2 which causes some foaming on the surface.  This could be a problem if you are brewing 10-cup batches with a full filter and you restrict the flow with the second position on the filter basket switch, so beware.  Commercial coffee, especially pre-ground, will not usually foam as it has already begun to stale.  I would recommend brewing with the filter basket cover removed until you get a feel for how the water flows through your coffee.  Overflow is certainly possible but not likely with the switch fully open, and my 10-cup batches with very fresh coffee came only to 1/2' of the top of the filter basket.  If you get an overflow, then, you either have ground the coffee too finely and/or you are using filters that are too restrictive.  I use Filtropia and Melitta, preferring the former. The power is controlled by a single switch.  The light on the switch stays on following brewing, but the coils shut off automatically at the end of a brewing cycle and the brew light goes out.  There is no timer, which is often a complaint if you're too lazy to grind and brew when you wake up.  I always grind fresh and brew with fresh water and it takes only 60 seconds to fill the chamber, grind a couple of scoops of coffee and press the button.  I prefer this to having a chamber full of stale water overnight. The stainless steel carafe is a vacuum carafe and is perhaps the weakest link.  I cannot imagine using a glass carafe with this machine, as coffee temperature is the whole purpose of the design, and an uninsulated glass carafe is good only to keep the coffee from spilling on the counter!  This carafe keeps coffee hot for hours.  Pouring is the only issue I might have here.  The pour lip has no dimple and if you pour with the screw-in lid, it can spread a bit along the lip and cause some spilling.  On the other hand, if you loosen the lid, turn it to the proper 1/4 positions and pour slowly, the coffee comes out leaving a nice ring of fresh-coffee bubbles inside the rim of the cup.  This may well have been intended, as everything else on this device is well engineered.  Just don't get in a real hurry to pour with the lid on.  You can, of course remove the lid to pour. Overall, the best of the best with the vacuum carafe.","Near perfect function, a few very minor flaws",Amazon,429

It makes great coffee in spite of its many design flaws.  The plastic base that comes with it is totally worthless and we discarded it within the first week.  There are plastic covers on the water reservoir and coffee cone which are just about as useless as the base.  We still have them but never bother putting them on. The drip mechanism does a poor job of distributing the water.  Except for when it first starts it essentially poors a single drip into the middle of the cone.  We first thought it had somehow clogged but it is just the way it was designed. The plastic filter cone also leaves a lot to be desired.  It has a switch on it to either have the drip opening open full, half, or closed.  On more than one occasion this has been bumped to closed, resulting in overflow and a big mess.  There doesn't seem to be much discernable difference between full and half open.  Considering the price of this coffee maker this is really cheap.  Also, when fully closed it still drips, meaning that if you pour a cup before its finished brewing you always have some mess to wipe up. There was clearly no thought put into the design of the pour flange on the carafe.  For one, it is relatively sharp and my wife has actually cut herself on it.  The biggest flaw however is that there is no pour groove and as a result pouring coffee, especially into a thermos, is a slow and often messy process.  I take a thermos to work daily and am considering getting a funnel. In spite of all this it still makes good coffee.  When it comes time to buy a new coffee maker however we'll look for something else.",Makes good coffee in spite of its design flaws,Amazon,10
4199,Technivorm Moccamaster,"December 24, 2009","Technivorm Moccamaster 79115 KBT Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Stone Grey",B07DDRGVW7,2,"The Moccamaster makes a very good cup of hot coffee.  But so did my Capresso and the Capresso cost 1/3 the price of the Moccamaster.  For a coffee machine to be priced at $250 or more, it should not have any major design or performance issues.  Unfortunately, the Moccamaster suffers from several design omissions including the following: * There's no clock or automatic setting on the machine - if you like waking up and having coffee already brewed you can't do this with the Moccamaster. * Many coffee machines have a feature that allows you to remove the pot while coffee is still brewing.  When you return the pot, the machine enables coffee to flow into the pot again.  The Moccamaster has a manual switch which allows you to turn off the flow of the coffee but you need to remember to return the switch to the 'on' position or the next time you brew coffee it will overflow the filter and spill a pot of coffee onto the counter.  Since the Moccamaster does not have a clock and auto-brew capability, you're going to be waiting for the coffee to brew in the morning.  This can seem like an eternity when the coffee is basically brewed and you're waiting for the last couple of drops to come out of the filter.  If you pull the pot out too early, the last drops spill onto the counter.  If you use the manual switch to turn off the flow, you risk forgetting to turn it back and having your next pot overflow the machine. * The last one is truly unforgivable --- Most coffee pots have a narrowed spout that channels the coffee into your cup and makes it easy to pour.  The Moccamaster pot does not have this kind of spout and you need pour slowly and carefully or you will spill the coffee.  This design issue is obvious to anyone uses the Moccamaster pot.  I find it amazing that a manufacturer would create a product with so glaring a defect.  Truly unforgivable in a machine of this price. Bottom line... The Moccamaster makes a good cup of coffee but design omissions make it a poor value compared to most machines on the market.  Save your money and buy something else.",Poor Value Due to Design Omissions,Amazon,21

However, it often overflows the basket (water flow too fast for rate of drip). I have to babysit it while the coffee brews. To prevent an overflow and ruined pot of coffee, I turn the machine off about 3/4 of the way through, wait a minute, and then turn it back on. This works and the coffee is perfect, but after 2 years of this, I am tired of being a baby sitter. It overflows with both paper filters and a permanent gold filter. I like my coffee strong and use a fine grind, which may contribute to my issue. However, I used the same grind on my previous coffee maker, and it did not overflow. One extra piece of information: I live at high altitude (7800 ft), so perhaps the resulting lower boiling point of water is causing the water to flow faster. In any event, I am shopping for a new coffee maker so I can make coffee without having to be a babysitter. Also, I am tired of having to make another pot when I get distracted and the coffee maker overflows.","Great Coffee, Overflows",Amazon,14

Even though that was the case, this machine was pretty easy to figure out, plus there are online manuals. I use the automatic brew function every morning for my work-coffee (very simple), and I utilize the 1-4 button, which slows the water release, letting the grounds saturate for longer, enhancing taste and aroma. There is definitely a difference when making the same amount of coffee. The engineering of this product is where my 5 star review really earns its money. Everything feels so sturdy. Perfect heft to the espresso tray. Stainless steel espresso filter is easy to clean. The included coffee ground reusable filter has a handle for easy removal, as does the filter holder, and the water reservoir. You can actually toss the filter holder into the machine and it will correct itself into place, same with the filter. The water reservoir has that satisfying slow descent when letting gravity take over. On the espresso side, damn. I am an internet barista, which means I read some articles and watched a YouTube video prior to making my first shot/drink. So my first shot was decent, but I change little things here and there and my latest drink was on the money. No more $6 espresso drinks for me. You do need to heed the advice of the top review and run the water through once before adding your espresso grinds. The machine needs every hose, component heated up. World of difference. And run the frother once into an empty cup until steam shoots freely. Most things in life need to warm up from a cold start. Components are easy to clean. Everything is very intuitive. Take care of it, clean after each use, and you will reap the benefits.

Also, do not make an espresso and walk away as it will keep brewing and overflow your now watered down espresso. You actually have to start and stop the espresso.

There are also better coffee makers on the market. But for a machine that will perform both tasks without spending at least four figures, this is the best I have found so far. I have had it for over a month now and it has been in a state of constant use. Any problems I have had are the fault of the operator not the machine. I have had three similar machines previously, all made by Krups. My last Krups  (a model no longer available) was a fine machine and it had advantages as well as disadvantage when compared to the DeLonghi. The Krups had a feature that allowed you to select either a single or double shot of espresso and the machine would shut off as soon as that amount was brewed. With the DeLonghi you have to shut it off manually and it can be difficult to be precise. On the other hand. the DeLonghi makes a much richer and darker expresso. The frothing wands on all of the Krups tended to be problematic. Sometimes they worked well and sometimes not at all. The DeLonghi frother works better and much faster. So far it has given me no problems. I am also impressed with the overall quality of the DeLonghi. The controls in particular have a nice solid feel. it is also an attractive unit which blends nicely with my kitchen decor. I must say I was a little uneasy buying a DeLonghi. I've never had one of their products and really did not know what to expect. The reviews were mostly positive but not without exception.

The decanter is a disaster, I defy you to pour a cup without dribbling and I mean seriously leaking all over the counter.

My other issue is where the gauge for filling the drip tank is under where the basket swings open, I have to use a flashlight to see what the level is because if you over fill it it pours out an overflow hole in the BACK of the unit.  This is a major problem for me it takes lot of time and wrangling to fill and its probably half the time i have problems.  You think why not just fill the decanter and pour it in and it will measure for you, answer is because the decanter dribbles all over the place.

The drip coffee maker is a pretty basic drip coffee maker. It has a timer to set it to start in the AM. There is a 1-4 cup option which is supposed to brew slower to make a better coffee for 1 or 2 people.  Putting 4 cups (via the carafe) in is not enough for 2 people, it's like 1.5 servings. I find filling the carafe to 5 or 6 cups and putting 4 or 5 scoops of grounds in makes the perfect amount for 2 people (about 12oz each).  I think the temperature could be a few degrees hotter, but it's plenty hot to enjoy. The espresso maker is fun. It takes a little bit of learning and experimenting to get it down. I ended up getting a little metal pitcher for the milk and some shot glasses for the espresso. I mean, I want to look cool when I make it right?? I haven't had any issues with it leaking like others claim. To the people who say it leaks around the espresso part I have to think that maybe it's just not being properly cleaned.  The espresso filter comes apart into 5 different pieces, and when I clean it, there is bits of coffee everywhere.  The underside where the filter attaches to the machine gets gunked up with grounds and residue too. I think if you were to use it 5 or 6 times without properly cleaning, it could build up enough to cause a leak.  So just clean it well after every use and you won't have any issues. I did have a little buyers remorse after buying this.  I'm not using the espresso every day since it's a little more work.  I think for the money you should buy a nice drip coffee machine for $50 and then spend $100-$150 on a decent little espresso maker.  The combined unit is rather wide and takes up some counter space.  I would rather have 2 units and tuck away the espresso machine until the weekend when I use it. I don't think this is a bad deal. I think you're paying like $150 for the espresso part and $50 or so for the drip maker. My biggest complaint is the milk steamer wand, I wish it were a little longer and that it swung out a little bit more.  Sometimes it's hard to get the milk container in there, I have to tilt it to get it in. Other than that, it's easy to use, makes good coffee, makes a nice steamed milk and the espresso is fine. I probably need to get a darker coffee for better espresso, but so far I'm happy with the results",Nice unit to have combined. You may save a little money if you buy 2 separate machines,Amazon,0

It is nice to have the option of both espresso and drip coffee. Overall, it is a nice design. However, there are major issues with the carafe design. 1. You have to be very careful when you pour the coffee. It drips and streams liquid everywhere. I've confirmed it is not 'user error' since we have had issues with everyone who has tried to pour themselves a cup of coffee. I put paper towels down around the coffee maker because it is inevitable that coffee will spill on the counter and the floor. 2. The carafe top has broken off and no longer stays on the glass part of the carafe. Helpful note: You will need adequate room above and to the right of this coffee maker to open the water reservoirs. The water reserve for espresso lifts up from the top of the machine. And to fill the drip coffee water reservoir, you must swing open the area above the carafe to the side of the machine making the footprint of the machine several inches wider than it appears.

I feel compelled to leave a review. So many people are complaining that this machine doesn't make a hot cappuccino. After making my first few cappuccinos, I too, thought the machine couldn't make a hot drink. As I researched more about cappuccinos, and how to steam milk properly, I learned a LOT. So first off, the guide that comes with the book, doesn't allow NEARLY enough steam to make the milk hot. So yes, pouring ice cold, slightly frothed milk in the cappuccino will leave you with a cold drink. However, if you add more water than needed, and shut the lever off after you received your desired amount of coffee, that leaves more water left over to steam your milk for a longer amount of time. You should be steaming your milk until the outside of the frother jug is just too hot to touch. That means it's reached a good temperature. When you pour that into your capp, it'll be nice and warm -- and stay warm! Just felt I should put this out there and maybe help someone else struggling with making cappuccinos.

I had the previous version of this machine and LOVE it but it broke after only 18 months, which is pretty unacceptable for a $200+ coffee machine.  I purchased this one to replace it, but I don’t like it as well. The coffee machine works exactly the same, so no difference there.  The espresso part is where I have issues. On the older version of the espresso machine the coffee grounds holder was MUCH bigger - probably double the size.  This one is very small and even the bigger holder (2 are provided) makes very weak espresso if you’re making 3-4 servings.  So I have to watch it carefully to make sure it doesn’t go over 2 servings, then I have to dump the grounds and start all over again if I want to make 3-4 servings. Kind of a pain!  With the old version you placed your water in the top and you’d use it all at one time.  The newer one has a hatch that opens and you put the water in this plastic basin, but not all the water drains out, so there’s always a bit of water in it. I don’t like the taste of water sitting around in plastic. I know this is nit-picky, but stale water is gross. The espresso also doesn’t seem to be very warm and it seems to take longer to make my espresso and steam my milk using this new machine versus the older version.

4387,DeLonghi,"January 4, 2018","DeLonghi BCO430 Combination Pump Espresso and 10-cup Drip Coffee Machine with Frothing Wand, Silver and Black",B01JP0LAN6,5," I bought the Delonghi for my wife as a xmas present. Our Krups espresso/coffee maker died after 23 years of service (the espresso side, still made amazing coffee though) and they no longer make a combo machine. I was somewhat concerned with the avg 3 1/2 star rating. After using the machine and making several cups of coffee and espresso as well as some cappuccinos. I must say we should have replaced our Krups 867 much sooner. Little did I know that it (Krups) was a very low pressure espresso maker 1 bar vs the 15 bar of the DeLonghi. That makes a huge difference in the taste as well as the crema delivery. I will start with the coffee maker. The swing out door is very nice and very easy to pour water into. I an not sure why some reviewers stated that it is a pain and they get water everywhere. I found the set up great and extremely easy to use. Another nice touch is the water level gauge on the side. If you didn't pay attention to how much water you just added it is a nice quick way to check. No guessing. The warming plate keeps the coffee warm for two hours after brewing and everything is a breeze to clean up. Yes it is just a coffee maker and there are simple however coffee makers can either burn coffee with the process of brewing or the hot plate can be either to cold or to hot. This machine seems to have a great balance and brews a great cup of coffee. On the espresso side. This is a very impressive machine for its price point. $199. The machine makes really good tasting espresso. (I am sure some of this comes down to the selection of beans and preparation of the grind before you start. For me it took just a few tries to find the perfect balance of grind and tamper.) I will provide some tips after my review. As far as pulling a shot and using the machine. It really is not difficult. The instructions could really use a rewrite for anyone that has never made espresso but as long as you follow them and read them over along with the quick start guide you will get the idea. Clean up is easy and I found that reviews of the machine being messy was a matter of people not having patience. As long as you do your clean up after your have finished your espresso. Clean up is a easy. 1st dump out your used grinds, clean the filter head with a damp cloth then remove the drip tray. Speaking of the drip tray. I like the fact that there is a red float to let you know that it is getting full if you forget to empty after a few espresso pulls. The espresso itself comes out with really good crema and as long as you follow through with the warm up process the espresso will stay warm in the cup for a good bit. Now why a 5 star rating? Well I am rating a $199 product. And for the money spent, this machine exceeds my expectation of what a machine at this price should do. I see people rating this machine at 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 stars because it does not work as well as their $500 dollar or $3k barista machine. Guess what reviewers, people want an honest review of the machine and I feel and honest review is how the machine preforms, looks and delivers for the money spent. Not a review for if a handle is broken due to shipping or its missing a part. Reviews are not about the UPS driver or a packing error. My tips for getting the best Espresso pull from this Machine. I run the machine though one cycle of just water. I only run the machine till the green brew light turns off. After which I dump out the warm water, I then place my cup on top of the machine,the espresso side,upside down to preserve what heat is in the cup while I prepare the filter with my grinds. (which I pre-grind shortly before starting the machine).When grinding my beans I use a setting that the grinds look like the in-between table salt and sea salt. I also tamp the grinds with about 25 lbs to 30 lbs of pressure with a slight twist of the tamper at the end of pressing. For cups I use good porcelain cups. They retain the heat well. I run the machine till about 2 oz of espresso is delivered. This seems to provide the best results for great tastes and crema on top. I hope you found this review helpful and the tips worth while. Jan 22, 2019. 1 year follow up. Machine has been working great! Wife uses the coffee machine side every day since Christmas 2018. Only maintenance I have done is the water filter pack each month. Other than that coffee maker has been great. On the Espresso side. I use that about once a day during the winter and during the summer only on the weekend. Has worked flawlessly since Christmas as well. I have only changed the tank filter twice. I feel that my experience with the machine is either very lucky compared to other reviews or that I am taking better care of my machine by keeping the machine clean and changing filters on a regular basis. Either way, we continue to be very pleased with our machine.",This machine makes some great coffee and espresso. (with 1 Year follow up.),Amazon,22

The Grandfather loves straight, simple brewed coffee. The Grandmother loves hot tea. The Mother loves iced tea. The Father enjoys hot chocolate, and the Son loves espresso. For $150, you get a machine that can pretty much make any beverage at a Starbucks. There are two water tanks- a removable one for the espresso/hot water/frothing wand and an innovative front loading one for the coffee. This works well for our kitchen shelf, which with other machines has involved pulling the unit out of the shelf before poring into a small space in the corner. Nearly everything with this unit can be done from the front, except changing the water filters. Machine is a great value for the benefits of two separate units, and cheaper than many espresso machines. The machine controls the water temperature, but user is responsible for starting and stoping the water flow. The ESE (Easy serving espresso) pods are super easy to use, and completely optional. The open source standard keeps prices down and they are available in all different brands of coffee from cheap to gourmet. We originally started with loose coffee, but then switched to the pods after issues with grounds getting everywhere during the tamping process. The milk frother is straight forward to use and doubles as a hot water outlet for americanos, tea and instant coffee. Keep in mind that the machine does not come with a frothing pot (get a good quality cone shaped one for better foam) or espresso glasses, but does include a combined tamper/coffee measure. If you decide not to use pods, be sure to invest in a better tamper instead of the plastic one that is included. The 16 bar pump pulls good shots with suitable crema and strength. Comes with two portafilters, for short/pods or long shots. Bear in mind that the coffe scoop that is included is larger than the portafilter. If you have no idea how to froth milk, basically pour the cold milk into the cup and leave it in the milk while swirling the milk around for wet foam, or move it up and down near the top for dry foam. When you feel the milk getting to the same temperature as Starbucks, pull it out. The machine is simple to clean- just bang the handle on the side of the garbage to dump out the coffee, and run the frother under the tap for a few seconds. Every week or so, empty the (removable) drip tray and clean out the handle, portafilters, and area where the handle is locked in. Every few months, de-scale the unit and switch out the filters. About the drip coffee unit, pretty standard. Programmable brew times and auto-stop. Carafe is sturdy and has a well designed spout that prevents any dripping and fits perfectly into the port for the water tank. If you are only making a few cups, definitely turn on the 1-4 cups button. It does something patented that really improves the flavor. So far, there has been no mechanical issues but I will update if anything happens.",Great machine for families with widespread beverage preferences,Amazon,9

And you should also have some understanding of what to expect from a machine of this type before you make your purchase. This machine is for those who want to be able to make espresso/cappuccinos/lattes at home, but don't want to dive Right in to the higher quality and much more expensive machines that require understanding of grinding, tamping, and even technique of milk frothing. Here are some things to consider: 1. This machine is built with forgiveness of your grind settings and tamping, as are all machines that utilize a pressure basket, which helps you achieve the correct pressure via the basket instead of with the grind/tamp of the coffee. 2. Unlike a true boiler system, you have to preheat this machine prior to brewing. This is done by turning on the machine with the power button on the side, allowing the machine to heat up, the running a brew cycle without coffee until the light goes off. Once that happens, turn off the brew cycle and wait for the light to come back on. One tip, install the brew basket without grounds during this heat up cycle to make sure the whole system is at optimal temperature for brewing. 3. Froth your milk first, then brew your espresso. Countless hours of watching videos and reviews on espresso machines has taught me this. Reason for this step is that once brewed, the coffee starts to degrade and cool quickly after brewing. The milk will hold up and remain hot during the short process of brewing the espresso, which will give you a much smoother and warmer cup. After frothing, repeat the process of flushing the heater by turning on the brew process and then turning on the wand, which will running the remaining heated water out of the wand and not through the brew basket. And last tip, if you want more of a micro foam rather than the large bubbled foam (latte foam instead of cappuccino foam), remove the pannarello wand and keep the tip of the frothing wand just Bellow the surface of the milk (you should hear the air being sucked in by the steam pressure) and make sure the milk is swirling rapidly. Once you have the foam density you desire, submerge the tip to continue heating the milk until the cup is hot to the touch. This all was learned from doing the research before making a purchase. This is not the machine I had my heart set on, but it doesn't have the $600 price tag either. For under $200, this machine will make a good cappuccino and latte, as long as you follow the instructions. I really like having the ability to make a brewed pot at the same time for those that don't like the fancier coffee drinks, as the heating elements are independent from each other. I REALLY like the carafe and the set up of the drip side, minus the included filter. I have never cared for mesh filters. The wide spout pours perfectly as long as you don't try to fill a cup in an instant and just pour steadily. Honestly one of the best carafes  I have used. The reason for the 4 stars is simple. This machine was purchased for our camper, and we have a much nicer and higher end Delonghi espresso machine at home, and the quality of the brew basket on this machine is not near as good. There is nothing holding the brew basket in, our other machine has bars in the basket housing that holds it in with pressure. Also, this basket uses too much plastic in my opinion that your brew will flow across. The other design on our home unit is all metal. All in all, for a combo unit, this is a DECENT machine that will produce a good latte or cappuccino if operated properly, and a decent pot of drip coffee for the other half that prefer that. If you want to start down the expensive path of brewing espresso, this will get you heading in the right direction. But please, do your homework. There are many variables (grind, coffee type, etc.) that will affect the quality of your brew.",Decent for what you are paying,Amazon,277

The expresso side dribbles a little into the pan, especially if the water container isn't seated tightly.  Annoying.  The coffee pot also dribbles when you pour, you'd think an experienced manufacturer of coffee makers could design a pot that doesn't dribble?  The way you pour the water into the coffee maker is a bit awkward too.  You have to wait for the expresso side to heat up, the green light turns on well before the water is truly hot enough. Overall it makes good expresso and coffee so I am not returning it.  And it was half the price or less of the really fancy expresso makers.

After awhile it became tedious to make two shots with that thing and quite the cleanup, so I started looking for an espresso maker. My wife likes to make regular drip coffee, and I thought it'd be nice to find a machine that makes both drip and espresso, alas we come across this machine. Now we're both super big on reviews, and the 3.5 stars kind of made us hesitant, but we said screw it, let's give it a try. Let me tell you, this machine is wonderful. The 1-4 cups feature that strengthens the coffee and makes it more aromatic REALLY WORKS. My wife says she hasn't had better coffee, and she's even had it black (which she never does) ((We use the Lavazza Caffe Espresso ground coffee if anyone's interested)). On the espresso side, it works and makes great espresso with nice crema and is very easy to load in two shots. Despite what people say, the instructions really are straightforward if you just READ THEM. I use the steaming spout as well and it works as planned if you just follow the instructions. I've since made some very delicious cappuccino's/lattes and everything is quite easy and quick to use. Now I've only had for a couple days, and I can't speak for the durability part. Everything works as expected so far, and I'm worried based on other reviews about the fragility of the pieces. But if anything happens to break I'll have to come back and update my review. TL;DR - if you want to feel like you have barista skills but really don't and want to make delicious fancy drinks, 5 stars. - if you want the capability of making drip coffee that tastes better than normal and espresso at the same time, 5 stars. - if you're already a pro barista and want to complain that it doesn't 'meet up to standards,' probably 1 stars.

I'm drinking the best coffee since, well, I worked for Daily Caffe in NYC (bonus points if you understand the significance of that name).  Admittedly, that's only partly due to the machine.  The rest is the kind of coffee you buy, and whether it's ground appropriately for the kind of coffee you want (espresso or brewed).  A couple of things for newbs to understand (I was one too!) that the instructions don't make obvious: 1) 2 different On buttons, 1 on the left side for espresso, to pre-heat (not extracting); the other on the front panel is to actually begin brewing coffee.  They are not related in any way.  To sum up: to extract espresso is a two-stage process (pre-heat On, extract On).  To brew coffee is only one button-push.  Why they're not BOTH on the front panel is anyone's guess.  I can't imagine they expect people to leave the espresso heating element on all the time, while turning the coffee brewing on and off as needed.  (If you're doing this with this machine, don't!  You're asking for trouble long-term.) 2) Do NOT assume the front panel espresso button is the On button!  It should not be pressed in until you actually want espresso to begin exiting the machine.  While the brew On button immediately begins to brew coffee into the carafe, the side-mounted espresso On button simply warms up the machine for espresso.  After pressing the side-mounted espresso On button, you need to wait until the green LED on the front panel espresso button indicates it's ready for use (30-45 secs) THEN you can begin extracting espresso by pushing that front panel espresso button.  This is a manual machine.  It will keep pushing out espresso until you push the button again to turn it off. When I first started up the machine, after pouring in water into the espresso reservoir, I'd pushed the front panel espresso button AND the side-mounted espresso On button.  Pretty soon I had hot water spitting out of the espresso side, making a mess.  Lesson learned.",Best coffee and espresso since Daily Caffe NYC!,Amazon,42

The coffee maker works fine but the Carafe' is a bit small for my liking. Making Espresso is easy and cleanup is a breeze. The supplied instructions including how to install the water filter are very good. Now my reasons for the 3 stars relates to the Cappuccino making and the steamer. You get two coffee holders. One is deeper than the other for strength I guess. Espresso comes out fine and the manual stop button takes a bit of getting used to. I am spoiled by my 11 year old Tassimo, I guess. Well, the steamer works well but it takes a few tries before you get it right. Years ago, we had a Melita Espresso/Cappuccino machine, and I always got it right.

I like this newer model and especially like how the filter swings away from the coffee maker to fill with water and change the grinds.  No need to worry about upper cabinet clearance when brewing coffee! The espresso maker side does flip up for water fills which means I have to pull the machine out a little to fill the reservoir, but it holds a decent amount of water, so I don't have to do that very often.  My biggest complaint with this coffee maker is the coffee pot. It is a new design for the new model (my old pot doesn't fit the new machine).  It is a nice looking, sleek design, but the coffee spills out of the spout and the side of the coffee pot when I pour coffee into my mug. This happens when the pot is full for the first cup. It doesn't drip for subsequent cups, but it is annoying to have coffe dripping all over my counters every morning. It happens no matter how careful I am with pouring the first cup. There is also no sound indicator to alert you when the coffee is done brewing or when it shuts off.  Otherwise, it brews great coffee and the espresso is very good too.

We use this daily or sometimes twice daily for coffee. I didnt know it was possible but I think our coffee actually tastes better than our Joriushi coffee maker. I think this is because its not burning our coffee like the other one must have been. One sticking point is that you cant push it into the corner on the right side because the door needs a lot of clearance to swing open to access the coffee chamber. Overall I would describe it as not too heavy but taking up somewhat of a large footprint. It has a gold toned permanent coffee filter, however we use filters anyway just for easier cleanup. We have yet to try the luxury that is the auto-start timer, but it is another great feature this unit has that is worth mentioning. The body of the coffee maker is all shiny black plastic, detailed with brushed stainless and silver plastic buttons and lights. The espresso components are heavy and durable and the glass of the coffee pot seems pretty durable as well. Of course we wash the coffee pot by hand. Despite heavy use it is clear but if I want to clean any coffee stains, I just swirl an ice and salt combo around and rince and it looks brand new.

I’ve had it for awhile now. I remember the day I received it. I was not that impressed with the build/quality of it. I thought for the price range it felt cheap. Setting it up, the instructions are not that clear. It was odd that the coffee part came with a water filter but there is a filter for the espresso water filter and there was not one included. I still to this day don’t know where to get the correct one. I have called the company before with another machine and it literally took 14 months for them to fix an issue. I figured I keep looking around for the filter. There are a lot of parts so I spent a good time cleaning it and getting it ready. I wanted to make everything with it. Coffee is straight forward. However, you really have to be careful where you place this machine. It obviously has a big footprint but what I don’t understand that coffee water reservoir swings out from the right side. The left side has the milk frother. If you think you can place this in a small spot, don’t. It needs a lot of room to swing the filter open and room on both sides to work it. Plus you need to open the top back to get to the espresso water. It seems the design was not thought out well. Coffee is good but I have had better. I like that it has a built in warmer plate so you can grab more coffee on the days you need a pick up. The espresso part was not straightforward. It does come with two inserts parts. I needed to get a tamper, one that was the correct size. I also bought two Delonghi glasses, an espresso set, a stainless steel milk frother. The accessories add up quickly. I had issues trying to get a dark enough glass. There is not a setting for the level that you would like it to be as in strong or weak. I have used the milk frother but felt it was very flimsy and almost burnt my hands a few times. I used a 2% milk, it seemed to make a good froth. I bought some expensive coffee syrup to make cappuccinos. It is time consuming not only with making it but the clean up of all the parts. I like this machine but could easily live without it. There are more cons than pro. I am nervous after reading the other reviews that it only lasted a few months. Having dealt with the company before I will not be calling them if I have an issue.

The coffee maker is pretty straight forward with design taken into consideration. The tray for the coffee grounds slides to the side, fill it with a filter, and the water goes down a little chute, which is kinda cool. Press the new button and your coffee starts going. It makes a good cup of coffee when it is done. The espresso  machine on the other hand, has about 5 more knobs and buttons that is all very confusing if you never owned one of these before. And the instructions, which tries to illustrate via pictures, does a terrible job in both explaining how it is done, and the steps one takes to make it happen. I almost feel, not only are they poorly explained, but almost as if they are out of order. And the written instructions do not reference the pictures to help support the instructions. To get this right, it took a series of trials and mostly errors before I got an adequate cup of cappuccino. The espresso was a little easier, but even then, not all of the buttons are easily understood. A button will both drip and steam and you are not sure what goes where. So, if you are interested in this machine, I will give you a heads up, that for cappuccino you need to be patient. Hit the espresso button on the side, and the bottom steam button in the front, and turn the handle down on the side, and let the machine warm up. It may drip some water out of the spigot, so make sure it is over the reservoir. Once you can hear the steam come out, then you put your milk under it. Take your time getting the milk fully frothy and it will happen. Start shallow to get the top part bubbly. Move your cup up and down, along the parameters, slowly going deeper and deeper. Finally, when you feel its ready, you can tell because there is a slight smell of milk. Technically you want to do this after the espresso is poured so you put this on top. The espresso part as well, there are two filters. One is finer than the other, so you will need to let it go a little longer for the water to drain. The other thing with the espresso is you need to stop the brew time manually. It is not a designated amount. So you have to keep a watchful eye. All in all, after about a week of sorting it out, I finally got myself a nice cup of cappuccino. And it was good! So hopefully after this I can continue making a nice cup of cappuccino. I do find it some work, and perhaps about 5 minutes to get your cup prepared each time. I also find at this point, the machine drips a LOT of water which the reservoir you will need to drain frequently, and you will also want to clean the steam spigot each time because dried milk will eventually cover it. I can recommend this machine to make a good cup of cappuccino with some patience and trial. I gave this 3 stars due to the terrible instructions which impeded the learning curve for such a machine. I personally never made a home made cup of espresso or cappuccino, and this should not really be the project that it was or the mess that each time it would make.","After a week of fiddling, a good cup of cappuccino",Amazon,14

It served me well for a good 6-7 years and I loved coming down to my coffee all ready in the morning before work. But all of the sudden, I realized the coffee wasn’t super hot anymore after brewing, hence the decision to replace with something else. I THOUGHT that I wanted a put over type brewer with automatic brewing options, so I was thrilled to find the Oxo Barista Brain and bought it on Amazon. Let me just qualify from here on out and say that I’m PICKY about things in general, and completely anal when it comes to my coffee. So I got the barista brain all set up and cleaned out and was excited for the next morning. Here were my thoughts after trying it out: 1. The coffee was still not hot enough-  no matter what I did, NOT HOT 🌋. Then there was the DRIPPING when I’d pull out the pot after it was completely done, and have a drippy mess all over the counter. Ugh, you’d think for almost $200 they could work on that feature, but they actually refer to it in the user manual as just something you have to deal with. As for taste, it was ok, but nothing to write home about. And then there was the clock, which weirdly started reverting back to military time on its own! The Barista Brain was just overall a bust, so I retuned it. If you’ve made it this far in my review, then you’re probably wanting me to get to the Technivorm review!  Well here it is- first of all, I woke up to the realization that I really didn’t NEED the automatic start anymore because I just RETIRED (hooray)!  And this machine is so fast, that by the time I hit the on button and go around opening my shades in the morning...POOF, my piping hot, fresh coffee is there waiting for me. I LOVE THIS MACHINE. After the dripping snaffu with the Oxo, I purposely bought the Technivorm model with auto pause and pour, which works great. The mahchine itself is just BEAUTIFUL, and looks great on my counter. Although I’m with some other reviewers that they could’ve stepped up their game with the quality of the plastic pieces, overall the quality is definitely there in this brewer. As for the coffee- hands down the best I’ve ever gotten from a home brewer. Best part is that Amazon had one on a Warehouse Deal for $70 less because the box was damaged. It was completely brand new and unopened (thank you Amazon).  Anyway, I highly recommend this brewer- if you’re searching for the holy grail of coffee makers, pick this one and you won’t be sorry!",Finally found my ultimate coffee brewer!,Amazon,8
4491,Technivorm Moccamaster,"June 10, 2018","Technivorm Moccamaster 89912 Coffee Machines, 40 oz, Polished Silver",B006ZCE38M,3,"It is stylish, fit and finish are very good and the coffee is the hottest of any other maker I've ever owned.  It uses no computer boards or sensors it turns on and there is a water float that allows it to brew until empty.  This is a good thing in terms of repair but there is no delay time after infusing the coffee to allow it to bloom.  Reading the web others are simply pulling the carafe away for a few minutes after the grounds are wet.  I have watched the brew cycle with the grounds exposed to see it in action, not real impressive.  There are a series of holes in the spray arm, the first few getting the majority of the water.  The distribution is very poor over the coffee grounds and over extracts the coffee below the two holes that disperse the majority of the water.  Due to no one's fault but my own I cracked the water reservoir and contacted customer service to purchase a replacement.  Customer service was excellent in response time but fell short not willing to sell me the part I wanted.  Because the coffee maker had to come apart to replace it my only option was to send it in for 100 dollars for repair.  I believe any appliance I own, the parts should be readily available and I can decide if the repair is something I want to tackle.  I ended up removing the reservoir and using epoxy to repair the crack, all is good again but I should have been able to have bought a replacement part.  So as for a hot cup of coffee 5 stars but the execution of the brewing with its lack of attention to the proper extraction of the grounds makes it far from superior.

It is consistently hot (dialed in to their special temp- don't recall the magic number), the carafe keeps it reasonably hot for 3-4 hours, and the clean up is easy (one of the reasons I went for this one originally).  Keeping the grounds and reservoir far apart keeps the sludge factor down.  The water head  could use a better design -  I typically pull the carafe out a bit into the brew to allow the grounds to steep and a get a more even soak.

This is among the highest rated drip makers everywhere. Mostly, it seems, because it brews fast and at the recommend 200 degrees. No way was I going to spend over 300 dollars on a coffee maker, but when I saw the used ones for a discount I got one. Pros: I like the look and it takes less room on the counter, which is at a premium in our small kitchen. I can report that it absolutely works as advertised. I have an instant read thermometer that I could slip right down into the filter basket as it brewed and the temp stayed at a constant 200 degrees. It brews fast and the coffee tastes great. I like the carafe, it kept the coffee hot for hours. (I did preheat it with hot water before brewing) Cons: The price The way the carafe rim is designed makes it a little difficult to pour. Sometimes the pour is too wide and it spills outside the cup. Just takes a little getting used to. Also, the way the inside rim is designed makes it difficult to get the last of the coffee out. Having to preheat the carafe is a waste of water, but that is true of all carafes. I had to return it though because the reservoir leaked. There was a crack in it and a little water would drip out. However, I took the opportunity to perform a side by side test before I sent it back to help decide whether or not I would buy another used one. I bought a new Mr Coffee drip machine and brewed with both using the same amount (ounces) of (3 stage osmosis filtered) water and the same amount (grams) of the same coffee. I let the moccamaster brew just a little and let it steep the grounds for 30-60 seconds before letting it go through the whole cycle and used the strong brew setting on the MR Coffee. I honestly could not tell the difference in taste. I am no connoisseur though, by any means. I could tell the difference in temp though. My wife couldn't tell a difference in taste either. Bottom line, for me it is not worth the price over Mr Coffee ($200 more). I kept the Mr Coffee and will not be getting another moccamaster.

Time will tell, but I'm optimistic.  The Cuisinarts were finicky, even before they went out. This unit is incredibly easy to use and seems like it has a simple, yet high-quality design.  The simplicity of use is what we love about this unit.  The filter cup has a flat base, making it easy to set on the counter when filling with coffee.  Minor point, but better than having to fill it while in the unit.  The water holder is also easy to fill and has very easy to read fill lines.  The unit brews very fast - about 5-6 minutes and makes a great cup of coffee!  I'm not convinced that the coffee actually tastes any better, but I can appreciate the attention to detail regarding water temp and amount of time that the grinds are actually soaking.  The unit is very easy to clean, too, and the insulated pot keeps the coffee hot for at least an hour, if not longer.  (We go through it quickly!) We spent the extra money based on quality and expected longevity vs. expecting that taste would be dramatically improved.

The Bunn was a step up in coffee from the Braun but never wowed me with the results.

Cooks' Illustrated gave this their top rating, compared to other coffeemakers, in 2 different product evaluations (a couple of years apart). I spent a couple of years trying to decide whether to buy it.  This coffeemaker has the approval of some coffee industry group (SCAA), apparently hard to earn.  I've had this unit about 1 month so I can't speak to long-term durability. It does make a very good pot of coffee, because of a very powerful heating coil, which produces coffee at exactly the right temperature (195-205 degrees).  I found it comparable to a cup of regular coffee that I'd get at Starbucks. Technivorm makes units with the standard glass carafe and warming base, but the insulated carafe model (the one I have) depends on the insulation of the carafe to retain temperature.  The carafe itself is well-made, and freshly filled, the outside didn't feel above room temperature. Which means it's doing its job of keeping the coffee warm. Although the description says '10 cups', that's 10 European cups.  I found that the water reservoir holds a tad more than 1 quart. There is a base that clips onto the main unit, that the carafe sits on. It's about 1/8' thick and I really don't see the purpose. It does produce a pot of coffee pretty quickly -- under 10 minutes -- and does have a drip-stop feature so you can pull the carafe out and serve before the cycle is finished, without spilling coffee everywhere.  Some other reviews complained about the rounded lip of the carafe -- no pouring spout. I haven't found that to be a problem in pouring into cups.  The coffee seems to go where its supposed to.  So why spend 4 or 5 times what you'd pay for a Mr. Coffee or similar automatic drip machine?  It depends on how fussy you are about the coffee you drink.  If you really like, or don't mind the coffee produced by Mr. Coffee, then you can ignore the Moccamaster and save yourself a lot of $$$. The unit is tall (16') but will still fit on the counter under my kitchen cabinets. I'm not sure if that would work for everyone. The company recommends paper filters (doesn't include the 'gold' filter any more) because 'the gold filter will eventually clog with coffee' (you couldn't just run it through the dishwasher occasionally? ) The carafe comes with a brew insert -- allows the coffee to drip into the carafe without allowing much heat to escape. There's a regular screw-top cap that replaces that once the brew cycle's complete, to better insulate the coffee. It can be loosened to pour without completely having to remove it. Recently, Cooks' Illustrated gave the Bonavita a good review. It's quite a bit cheaper and makes a similar cup of coffee. I thought about getting it instead of the Moccamaster but didn't choose it because a number of reviewers complained about the fragile carafe. Pros: Makes good-tasting, hot coffee repeatedly;  simple to load and start, and to take apart for cleaning.Produces a full pot of coffee quickly;  carafe retains heat very nicely (company recommends that the coffee not be served longer than 20 minutes after it's made); drip-stop mechanism so you can remove the carafe and serve before the cycle completes. Cons: Price (obviously); Carafe must be hand-washed (company recommends not putting it in the dishwasher); parts (brew basket, water reservoir, covers, base, etc. don't appear to be any higher quality or more durable than those on a Mr.Coffee; completely manual operation (no automatic start timer, bean grinder, etc.); awkward to move -- the aforementioned flimsy base under the carafe doesn't really stay attached well, so if I try to pick up the entire unit, I'm at risk for dropping the carafe.

I use normal beans from brands you find at your grocery stores and they all tasted terrible. Turns out it was my coffee machine. Now I enjoy a clean flavor black coffee, where I can taste a nutty flavor with just regular brand beans! No more hiding my coffee in flavored creamers and sugar. This thing rocks. Just make sure the height will clear where ever you plan to put it. It also produces a bit of steam when brewing, so be aware of that if you're going to set it under your cabinets. Also the cup sizes are off compared to what I'm used to. I think they are in Euro cup sizes and the ounces don't match up to what we have in the US. I just filler-up and let it brew a full batch. The price is pretty high, but I think it's well worth it if you use this every day.",Amazing!,Amazon,3

I have to admit to being impressed and cowed by the sheer number of lay experts out there (all this talk of bloom, notes and acidity etc).  Still prefer mine with a bit of milk (sorry!), no sugar. The coffee: After all the glowing reviews, I had expected a transcendent brew, categorically beyond anything my pedestrian taste buds had experienced before.  No, this is still recognizably coffee, and while excellent, it didn't knock my socks off.  It is reasonably hot (confirmed in the 190's), but not scalding.  Several have suggested starting with room temp water, or preheating the thermos with hot or boiling water--too much fuss for me.  I've found that nuking (again, my apologies to the purists) a small amount of milk in the cup before adding the brewed coffee helps tremendously.  The first sips have been very satisfying.  I agree that the thermos does hold temp well, though after a few hours you might have to reheat to make it really hot again (sorry again).  The really impressive thing is that even several-hours-old still tastes close to the original, not rancid.  I can't say this has been true of ANY coffee maker I've ever used.  This may have something to do with a really tight seal on the travel lid.  You'll find after hours of cooling, the reduced temp creates a very strong vacuum which seats the lid firmly--try unscrewing it, and you'll think it's been glued on. The machine: beautiful visual design, excellent build quality.  I agree with several reviews the various pieces of plastic appear chintzy at first, but they seem to be made with high-quality plastic (not brittle) firmly attached.  BUT, I find the operation and ergonomics (another kind of design) to be fussy.  Too many pieces that have to be individually manipulated (taken off, put aside, reassembled): water reservoir lid, filter holder, filter holder lid, brew lid, travel lid (a misnomer--it's really necessary after brewing to maintain temp for any length of time).  This can be really taxing for my early morning brain--too many things to think about.  A great piece of industrial design should allow various parts to move but be parked close at hand.  Even my Krups from 10 years ago had a filter holder that normally hinged out for easy access without having to set it down on the counter (it could still be removed for easy cleaning in the sink later).  I agree with another reviewer that the thermos rim requires attention to keep from spilling over the sides of the cup when pouring; not too fast or too slow--also make sure the travel lid is unscrewed just the right amount or you'll get a mess.  The flat plastic base plate that goes under the thermos is the only real misstep.  Not sure what its function is, except to raise the thermos a 16th of an inch.  It fits into a grove under the machine, but without being attached in some kind of positive way.  Comes out if you so much as tilt the machine a bit when sliding on the counter--has happened to me several times. None of this is a show stopper, just annoying. I did once have the dreaded overflow from the filter--all over the counter, cabinets and floor.  Could have been the sample papers that came with the brewer.  The grind was the usual.  My only advice is the wait and make sure coffee is dripping into the thermos before walking away... Summary: Excellent coffee, beautiful visual design.  Fussy operation, a few engineering details that could be improved.","excellent brew, fussy ergonomics",Amazon,28
4568,Technivorm Moccamaster,"March 15, 2013","Technivorm Moccamaster 89912 Coffee Machines, 40 oz, Polished Silver",B006ZCE38M,4,"I frequently make coffee with a 'Hario' manual coffeemaker.  It works very well if you are careful about estimating water temperature, but I needed a coffeemaker that can make several cups quickly for company.  I had previously purchased an $80.00 Hamilton Beach coffeemaker that only lasted one year before the pump gave out.  The replacement was a cheaply-made Hamilton Beach that produced inconsistent water temperature; sometimes it burned the coffee, other times it wasn't hot enough.  I've also owned a Cuisinart ($120.00) that produced coffee with an awful burnt taste.  After adding up what I've spent on coffeemakers that didn't last very long & didn't make decent coffee, I realized it would actually be more economical to purchase one good coffeemaker with a long warranty.  After all, a lower price is meaningless if you have to buy a coffeemaker every year & you don't want to drink the coffee. My unit arrived today from 'Willoughby's.'  (Well, Amazon...they have a nice accessories package that includes two pounds of coffee, cleaners, two kinds of filters, etc. for the same price). I was a bit confused at first because the filter basket did not have a switch to adjust or block the flow of water into the carafe (as shown in the photo).  I guess they decided to discontinue that feature.  No matter; if you were to set the switch to 'closed' and you forget it, you'd have a big mess when the coffee overflows.  After running cold water through the unit twice as recommended in the manual, I brewed a 12-oz. cup.  I used a moderately-fine grind setting.  The provided scoop is two tablespoons.  I use a bit more than two tablespoons of ground coffee for each six ounces of water (suggested by 'Starbucks.')  I tasted it black first, even though I don't like black coffee.  Although I didn't use a thermometer, the temperature must be spot on because the coffee tasted great even before I added half & half & sugar.  It was also hot - the way I like it.  I heat up the half & half before adding it to coffee.  I also heat up the cup by putting boiling water in it for a couple of minutes.  The provided 'Brew Through' lid for the carafe is a great feature - it keeps the brewed coffee mixed while minimizing heat loss & you don't have to loosen it to pour coffee. I'm rather picky about coffee taste.  I tried the Willoughby's coffee (two pounds are included) & it's excellent.  It takes some of the edge off of the high price of the coffeemaker.  Two pounds of quality coffee beans would cost around $30.00.  If you add up the $75.00 in extras, the actual price of the coffeemaker is around $225.00. I learned something the hard way:  There is one part called the 'Outlet Arm' that you must NEVER touch while brewing because it gets REALLY HOT. UPDATE:  3-20-13:  I was concerned about the unit being defective when I noticed that four ounces of water stayed in the bottom of the tank after brewing stopped.  I started getting into the habit of turning the unit upside down & draining the tank.  The seller (Willoughby's) explained that it's normal for four ounces of water to remain in the water tank & most coffeemakers will do that.  I contacted Technivorm-Moccamaster Inc & they explained that the water left in the tank prevents the boiler from boiling dry.  It is only necessary to turn the unit upside down & drain that water if the unit will not be used for a long time.  The unused water will be recycled when the coffeemaker is used again. That is indeed correct.  I tested the unit without draining the water & 12 oz water = 10.5 oz coffee (of course some water is lost in the grounds). TIP:  Sometimes, the coffee comes out weaker than I like.  After watching the brewing process without the cover over the filter basket, I can see why.  It takes a minute or two for the hot water to soak all the coffee in the basket because the outlet holes are in a rectangular pattern instead of a round showerhead-type pattern.  If you like stronger coffee like I do & you have the newer model that does not have the control  switch on the filter basket: 1.  Start the brew without the carafe in place 2.  Depress that white safety button at the bottom of the unit to keep the water flowing into the filter basket. 3.  Move the outlet left & right to saturate the coffee at both ends of the basket. (Do not touch with bare fingers) 4.  Wait a couple of minutes until all the grounds are saturated. 5.  Slide the carafe in place (which depresses the white safety button) to release the coffee into the carafe. If the outlet had a showerhead spray pattern, I would have rated it five stars.  For the price, it should have been designed better. This increases the brew time & results in much stronger coffee.",Almost As Good As It Gets,Amazon,4

I have the Breville stainless Keurig version but needed a coffee machine to make a pot of coffee.  This works as described, does get the water hot and makes a quick 10 cup pot.  Tips after having for a year: 1. Run some water through first to warm up the carafe and also warms up the machine. 2. Use the paper filters as they seem to work better and not get any grit at the bottom of your cup. I love coffee and have had many people over, seems to taste better (or may be because I am justifying the $300. It has to be better than my $50 old Mr Coffee one).  I must say it is very simple and easy to clean.  The other cheap machines have the reserves at the bottom and get dirty after a few years.  This machine has everything right at the top and easy to see what needs to be cleaned. The stainless carafe also keeps the coffee hot enough for when you have company and even long enough for the morning. If you want a cool looking machine that gets the water hot and is not too expensive I highly recommend.",Moccamaster CDGT,Amazon,15
