So far so good. Pros:  1 - I tend to use a lot of coffee grounds when I make coffee and almost every other machine I have had has not kept the grounds in the filter - always letting grounds into the carafe (or reservoir in the case of the coffee station I last had.  This one has not overfilled the filter once.   2 - The drip-stop feature on most machines does not work work a darned, at least a few drops, maybe more fall onto the hot warming plate and eventually screw up the coating.  Not a drop for the Braun, and their mechanism seems more effective to me.   3 - Although all carafes designs have gotten better about drips when pouring into the cup, some have not.  The Braun carafe does not drip unless you try to pour from a full carafe to quickly. Cons:  1 - Only a minor complaint; the port through which you have to fill the machine with water is a little small, you do have to be careful and not pour to fast.

We also rely on the timer because we get up early & want to be able to grind/prep the machine the night before. Functionality: exceptional. Hands down one of the best we have owned. Every feature is simple. We could have done all of it without ever glancing at the instruction manual. We like the option to make a stronger brew & to adjust the temp of the hot plate. The timer has worked well, the display is easy to read. THE BEST thing which to be honest was the top reason I bought this coffee maker is it DOES NOT BEEP or make a sound when the pot is done brewing. When our kids are still asleep at 5am, we really don't need any noises echoing through the house. We just know that it will be waiting for us when we get up at our regular time. Quality: iffy. The jury is still out. The lid seems flimsy & makes a popping sound every time we raise it which sounds like it is breaking, but definitely 'normal.' The glass carafe also seems flimsy. The lid already has scrape marks from pulling it out to pour. The glass is already stained. It makes little sounds when you pour the water in that worry me it won't be long for this world. Feels lighter than average. That said, everything is intact so far. Overall I would recommend this coffee maker. My husband absolutely loves it. Coffee tastes excellent, which is the most important thing. We had a Cuisinart for about 10 years but took a chance on this despite inconsistent reviews. We do not have trouble pouring the coffee.

I looked at all the coffee makers out there and after reading all the good/bad reviews I decided to go with this Braun....and I am extremely happy I did (so far at least). Box came in good shape and the first thing I noticed when I took it out was the weight. This has some heft to it (which I like) and does not feel like some cheap plastic piece of garbage (like mr. coffee 12 cup - but that's another story.). I read and followed the instructions and had zero issues with set up. It had a very small amount of dust on the inside (no biggie), which I wiped clean with a lint free cloth (lint free cloth is important). I ran water through 4 times before the first brew to get rid of any residuals. First cup came out perfect. I have not tried the auto on feature yet because I like to grind my beans fresh in the morning, but I'm sure one day i will. Really like the 1-4 cup setting, it does a great job at brewing small cups. The bold/regular setting is nice when I use a lighter roasted bean vs dark. But the temp setting...wow, this thing can brew a nice and HOT cup of coffee! I prefer it scalding hot, which the hot setting does perfectly. I didn't really like the included reusable filter. It left too much of a sediment in my cup (partially due to an inconsistent grind IMO). Since we are on septic, I'm also super reluctant to dump things down the drain (even if its only a small amount of grind). So I got some regular cone filters and all is good. Overall, I've had it for a month now and absolutely love it. Highly recommend!!!!",Very Happy! Def Recommend!!!,Amazon,4

Braun. Krups. Black, white, mill and brew, and more. When my last Braun finally gave up after 10 years of faithful service, I went to buy another and found what you all found. They were gone from the U.S., driven out by a flood of cheap coffee makers. So, I began testing out all the runners-up. Cuisinarts came and went back. Zojirushi? Nope. Bonavita? Nah. And paying $300+ for a Technivorm Moccamaster? Forget it. I started getting my coffee on the outside, as they say. Then, last week, I was in BBB and saw this beauty. Was Germany back in the game? Turns out yes, but by way of China. And for all of you who think that’s a deal breaker, think again, my friends. I am happy to report that this new incarnation of Braun engineering, at least the KF 7170 that I have, is the real deal. Things I love: 1. That built-in lip in the back of the lid that catches EVERY drip of condensation and sends it back into the reservoir. 2. Coloring the steps in the water reservoir lime green. I can see them now! 3. All the adjustables; water hardness, warming plate temperature, brew strength (bold is really bold), and number of cups made. 4. Quiet operation. 5. Easy programming without having to be a math major. 6. Fair price. 7. Sturdy, substantial, and sleek design, with beautiful attention to fit and finish. 8. Oh, and AMAZING coffee, of course. UPDATE 5/1/18 First Clean Cycle! I've had this machine for about a month now, and with our hard water, the 'clean' light came on this morning. I don't like using chemicals, so I just poured a carafe of water in with a couple tablespoons of vinegar (no water filter or gold filter in there, of course). Then, I hit the 'clean' button, it flashes, then I hit the 'brew' button, now they are both flashing, and the machine just does its thing. The whole cycle only took about 15 minutes. Not sure why Braun says it can take up to 45 minutes, but mine was really fast. Then, both lights go off, I run one more pot of clean water through, and I'm good for another month. I'll keep updating as the months unfold. So far, so great. :)",Not Your Father's Braun...,Amazon,0

We have gone from 2 pots of coffee every morning to: get this... 8 CUPS TOTAL!  <= that is what a Braun does! I spent about 3 days researching coffee pots and finally decided to go back to my roots. Since the very first pot I knew that I made the right decision. It is the smallest station we have had in 5 years. We are thrilled with all the new counter space! It is easy to fill with water. Either using the carafe or with our sink sprayer. The fluorescent green water level indicator is impossible to miss! If you overfill, there are two overfill holes to drain the excess out the back of the pot. I am back to Braun's Gold tone Cone filter technology. Crisp and clean flavor from the very first sip. ***Remember NO SOAP! WATER, Braun descaling or VINEGAR ONLY*** The filter and basket blocking design is done very well. Especially for those who are sloppy with putting in their grounds. The bottom of the cone filter is flat enough to fill outside of the machine, which is my preference. There is minimal brew time or steam - even with a full pot and on strong setting. The adjustable temperature setting is AWESOME!  Keep in mind please - This is not brewing temp. This is burner temp. OKAY? It is delightfully quiet and gives off just enough aroma for me to get coffee and not permeate through closed doors and wake my husband two hours before he needs too.

One negative:  The water reservoir indicator is internal to the unit (i.e., there is no external window where you can see the water level you need to make your coffee).  Since the internal indicator is difficult to see (unless you use a flashlight), it is pretty much useless.

169,Braun,"February 19, 2018","Braun KF7150BK Brew Sense Drip Coffee Maker, Black",B01EA5ZHIA,3,"I wanted to like this machine. Braun made very good machines years ago, my favorite until no longer made for the US market. Now that Braun is back in the US, I was happy to buy this sleek, modern machine to replace our Waring Pro that recently failed. The Braun is easy to set up, looks great, and is ultra-modern. Unfortunately, it does not make great coffee that has rich, deep flavor. I believe it’s shortcomings lie in Braun’s desire to satisfy the market expectations of fast brew time, little to no loss of steam, and very little noise. Firstly, it brews quite quickly, even on the “bold” setting, which does slows it down by several minutes. However, brewing too fast reduces residence time between the grounds and water, leading to a weak brew product. Secondly, the machine produces very little steam, which appears to be the result of a low brewing temperature. I measured the brewing temperature on several runs at a consistent 180 degrees F, much lower than the optimal range of 195 F to 205 F. This, again, results in a weak brew product. Thirdly, it produces very little noise, also a result of a too low brew temperature. The top of the machine opens to reveal the grounds basket (cone) and the water inlet. Not a great design having both so close together, but not a deal breaker. What is concerning, though, is the size of the grounds basket. It is much shorter than the one in my failed Waring Pro. Using the same amount of coffee as i had always used in my failed machine, the used grounds formed up to the top of the basket, nearly overflowing. Adjusting to a coarser grind did not solve this issue. I could not test using more coffee to get a stronger brew because doing so will result in an overflow of the basket, either into the carafe or into the water inlet. The “bold” setting seemed to have no perceptible effect on the richness and flavor of the brew produced by the Braun, despite a slightly longer brew cycle.

I imagine the 'High' setting is McDonalds lawsuit mode which I can't see as being necessary. What I don't like about this machine: first, the water level indicator is AWFUL. You have to be pretty tall and have good light to see how much water you've put in the reservoir. I'm 6' tall and it's a pain. My wife can't see the indicator at all without something to stand on with the machine sitting on the counter. If it's a dark kitchen you're brewing in, it's very difficult to see the level even when you have a birds-eye view of the reservoir. That's poor design. They should have used a clear window side indicator like everyone else. There's a reason every other manufacturer does this - it works! The timer isn't very intuitive to set but it functions well.

I previously had a Mr. Coffee product which died on schedule after 1.5 years. The Braun is designed differently and like anything new, takes a moment to get use to operating. The scoop (without coffee) is the coffee maker fits under my cabinets with about 4 inches to spare. The easiest way to load the water and coffee is to remove the carafe and pull the coffeemaker out from underneath the cabinets so you have the clearance to open the top fully.  BTW, I'm 5.5' tall and really, it is no big deal! But you do need clearance to the right of the device because you will pour the water into an opening in the back right quadrant. There is absolutely no issue adding the coffee. The quality of the coffee improved after the first use. Yes, it is true you need to hit the green 'on' button along with the 'brew' button to start the machine. But if this is going to be upsetting, then you have other issues, unrelated to the coffee maker. Take-aways: The Braun operates as advertised and it's drip free.

Our water is NOT particularly hard and it's not dirty -- the machine is just fussy and demanding.

I ultimately landed on this coffee maker. I wanted something that looked sleek and modern, something that didn't take up too much counter space. I was coming from a Krups Cafe Duomo II; never used the espresso side of it so I couldn't comment on that, but after a year of use (it was hand me down that was never used, so it was like-new condition), I realized other coffee makers made hotter coffee. My parents who gave it to me initially have a Keurig, which I liked because we only really use one serving of coffee usually, but I hated how they looked. Kitchenaid made a nice looking personal size coffee maker but the thing was darn tall. Their drip coffee makers looked pretty awesome too, but reviews were lukewarm (no pun intended). I started leaning towards Bonavita, it was sub $150, had, stellar reviews, but when I saw a video review the thing looked maybe as big as the Krups Cafe Duomo II that I had, so that was nixed. Everything else I liked was above $150, then I stumbled on this. Reviews about coffee quality seem to be above par, it took up a lot less space (not as tall as the kitchenaid variants as well), had that stainless look I wanted, but not too much where it looked cheap like the cheaper coffee makers that just looked gimmicky. So I went with this one and don't regret it. The coffee comes out piping hot, the warm plate seems to keep it fairly warm (has multiple settings as well if you don't like it too hot), there's a cleaning reminder on it, bold and regular settings. The carafe doesn't seem to drip (did one time because we poured way too fast, like dumping the coffee out), and anti-drip system seems to work well too (Krups would leak when it would stop mid flow). You can purchase a thermo carafe if you choose so from Braun as well if you wanted that. I love how there is no steam that comes out from this unit like cheaper units and my previous Krups did. You don't see condensation on top. They made it form instead and drip back into the water well, so you can turn it on and push it back under the cabinets without worrying about moisture getting on your wooden cabinets. The water well is a little smaller, but we haven't had issues; we pour from the mug to measure how much coffee we make. The only things I didn't like were the buttons felt a little spongy (not premium), and that 'premium' display looks really cheap (contrast is lacking, no brightness settings, cant keep it off unless you unplug it). One thing that would make this even better is if the lid was slow closing mechanism so it doesn't slam (for something about $80+ depending on the finish you get). Minor things, I would get this 4.5/5 if I could, but rounded up because I'm really happy with the quality of coffee this makes (not a coffee conosuier by any chance though, but it tastes a lot better now, much smoother and hotter).",which I liked because we only really use one serving of coffee ...,Amazon,32

310,Braun,"May 15, 2017","Braun KF7150BK Brew Sense Drip Coffee Maker, Black",B01EA5ZHIA,5,"I have to admit I have a bit of a love affair with my morning coffee. However, the one who has it freshly brewed and waiting for me in the morning when I shuffle into the kitchen with bleary eyes, is taking a close second.  After the first few sips, my eyes begin to focus and I admire the sleek styling and cheerful (but classy) green indicator lights of the Braun coffee maker. I love the fact that the unit takes up less than 8 inches square of counter space and being only 14 1/4 inches tall, it neatly fits under my overhead cabinets. I adore that both the water reservoir and the coffee carafe have specially designed lids to collect the steam and condensation and return it to the pot. This works so effectively that when setting up the coffeemaker for the following morning, I can push the coffeemaker back into place under my overhead cabinet and not worry about steam ruining the wood cabinet doors. Other coffeemakers we have owned in the past have sputtered and spewed steam during the brewing process, fogging up glass doors and leaving a hot mist on cabinet doors.  The only negative thing I can think about this coffeemaker is that it is somewhat awkward to fill the water reservoir, but I'm getting used to it. I have been using paper filters in the cone because I like the easy clean up and have not experienced difficulties as a few reviewers have expressed. We did have to experiment a bit to get the coffee strength to our liking. I think this is due to the steam capturing lids...more water ends up in the pot than with other coffeemakers, so you need to add more ground coffee accordingly.

I owned the Braun for 4 weeks when I started having the coffeemaker stop functioning properly. It would stop brewing when only half the water was brewed. This got progressively worse until it stopped brewing completely. I have had 3 lengthy telephone conversations with Braun Customer support. I have been told I will get a replacement. Countless emails with receipt copies AND pictures of me cutting the cord off the coffeemaker (as requested by support) get NO replies .

I saw the price drop and jumped on the most affordable of the three Brew Sense models.  The only reason I don't give this five stars is the LCD Clock display is next to impossible to read.  Also, the box says the controls are 'Intuitive' but you'll need to read the instructions that come with the Braun.  The 'Auto Off' timer sets the amount of time the warmer will stay hot after brewing, but you need to press the button before or during Brewing as it does not function automatically by default.  The default shutoff is two hours after brewing has finished. This model came with the gold brew filter which I guess I missed in the description.  The level indicators in the reservoir are easier to use than some reviews led me to believe, as long as you pour from the left side of the machine by the water filter.  Speaking of the water filter, we use bottled water so we don't need the charcoal filter, but the green plastic indicator would not stay in place on the handle (it indicates when the water filter was last changed) and would be easily moved when filling the tank. Lastly, I feel that if the lid could open another 15˚-30˚ it would make pouring water into the reservoir a lot easier.  Our Braun is out in the open and not under a counter so this isn't a problem.  There would be no way to fill this without moving it out from under the cabinet in a normal kitchen. The coffee we've made so far has been flavorful and clean up is a breeze with the removable filter basket that snaps back into place.

I've used manual filter coffee makers for most of my life till I switched to the automatic coffee maker 2 years back. I started with the Hamilton Beach Brewstation. Though I had few issues(leaks, display, noise), I did not feel to switch my coffee maker. The Braun KF7150 was my 2nd coffeemaker that I had tried and is leaps ahead of my previous one. I've been using this coffeemaker for now only less than a month. So, I cant comment on its longevity. Its got one of the most beautiful design which makes very good coffee. Here are some of the things I rate this coffee machine very high: - Easy setup (took me less than 5 mins) - Quick coffee (takes less than 5 mins for 12 cups of coffee) - LED panel and controls are very easy and does not require a manual (if you've previously used a coffee machine) - Easy maintenance.Keeping the filters, carafe clean and the clean cycle is simple. - Keeps the coffee hot for an extended period of time - Allows you to prepare smaller cups of coffee (I usually prepare 4 cups a day). There is a separate setting for this (1-4). - Programmable setting for morning coffee. There is a auto-on and auto-off feature. - Strength feature allows you to set the strength of the coffee (I always take my coffee bold and hot) - Charcoal filter for purifying the water that is used to make the coffee Some of things that can be improved: - A little noisy when brewing coffee - Once carafe is taken out for pouring, the ability to keep the coffee hot goes off.

On other makers the water did not distribute over the grinds as well as this unit which resulted in one side of the cone filter falling over.  Once that happens, the hot water will run around the filter and the beans. 3) Makes a good cup of coffee. The bad (and I regard this as very bad) 1) Unlike other coffee makers I have owned, this one does not have a clear area on the side of the water tank with cup markings.  Instead, the markings are inside the dark tank.  Even with a flashlight, I have problems reading the marks.  If you have bifocals like me forget it!

It does however, still come with the permanent filter basket, water purifier, and coffee scoop.This is Braun's most basic coffee maker model so it lacks some of the advance controls of the more expensive model. So, for instance, it lacks the ability to set brew strength. So there are two issues I have with this coffeemaker. First, is the stupidly designed water level indicator INSIDE the reservoir. So basically you have to peer down in there to look at the water level while pouring it in. Second, this coffeemaker has an issue with water evaporation so 8 cups ends up more like being 7 cups. But the bottom line is that this machine makes excellent coffee. It seems to raise the water temp up higher than a lot of other coffeemakers and takes its time brewing.

It tastes more rich and not like something you would get out of a Styrofoam cup from the doctors office lol. Seriously though, it's a very fine filter.  I have had no grounds whatsoever in my cup and even that happened in my old maker. Clean up is easy peasy. No risk of the paper tearing up and messing on the way to the garbage.  I love that when you fill it with water, it had step looking pinpoints for how much you are putting in. Perfect with my eyesight. I'm not trying to dial in and see numbers on the side while I'm pouring water through the top. It's right there. So easy to see and read. I like the filter option. I'm aware it's not necessary.

The design with the extensive use of stainless steel on the shell is attractive.

449,Braun,"December 9, 2016","Braun KF7150BK Brew Sense Drip Coffee Maker, Black",B01EA5ZHIA,1,"I am not too impressed with the 'features' on this coffee maker. My biggest gripe: The water level indicator for the reservoir is inside the reservoir with some sort of stepped dip stick of sorts. You are suppose to look into this dark reservoir and see the level of the water against this indicator. My coffee maker is black making it hard to see a water level against a black background. Braun needs to put a window that can be read from the outside much easier; the way they have done in the past with a float showing the water level clearly. Another feature: a 1 to 4 cup setting that is never explained fully. Instructions say to use this feature if you are making 1 to 4 cups and explain how to turn it on. Absolutely NO description of what it does. Does it brew faster, slower, more water, less water; who knows. Glad I didn't buy the higher end models. More worthless features I'm sure. I had a hard time finding a coffee maker with a cone filter. None of the manufactures make it clear what type of filter they use. Braun included. I feel cone coffee makers make better coffee especially when brewing small quantities. This one has a cone filter. The pros: It makes coffee. Hence the three stars. Update: I have been using this coffee maker for a couple of weeks now and felt compelled to update this review. I HATE THIS COFFEE MAKER!!! I mentioned the problem with determining the water level in the reservoir. Still a problem but, I also found out Braun decided to make it difficult to fill using the carafe. The lid on the carafe and the lid coffee maker are in the way of each other and prevent a decent pour resulting in water all over the burner and counter sometimes. Did anyone at Braun test the design? The coffee maker has an auto shutoff too. Always a nice feature when you forget to turn it off manually. And this maker has an adjustable time for the auto off. The problem is you have to turn the auto off feature on in order for it to work. Great! A feature for the forgetfulness that requires you to remember. I have changed the 3 stars to 1 and the review title to more accurately reflect how I feel about this piece. Too much to $end it back and too much of a hassle. Someone at Goodwill will soon find a new coffee maker on the shelf. I am now looking for something else. Something other than a Braun. It is too bad.

It looks sleek, buttons have a nice feel, but unfortunately, it does not brew good quality coffee. I compared the brew from this machine to brew out of my benchmark coffee maker, a Bonavita BV1900, and the differences were apparent right away. Coffee from the Braun was noticeably more acidic, and lacked depth. This was the case with all three of the coffees I tried on it. The sweet, buttery, and chocolaty flavors that I normally get with the Bonavita were missing from the Braun. All of the coffees tasted very dull, and unpleasant. On the plus side, the machine does make surprisingly hot coffee, but I have a feeling this is due to the warming plate heating it up during brewing rather than the brew temperature itself. My taste tests seem to mirror those done by another group of people at 'The Sweet Home'. Braun scored last place overall against 4 other coffee makers for its relatively high price and disappointing coffee quality. Buyer beware. Don't be fooled by the snazzy looks and marketing.

It looks great, the controls are very intuitive (I still haven't even read the instruction manual), the coffee comes out hot and very well brewed.  My only complaint is how Braun decided to indicate the water level inside the reservoir.  Instead of a simple sight glass on the side of the coffee maker, you have to look inside the reservoir from the top at a stair-step gage which is almost impossible to read without a flashlight.  A sight glass would have been so simple.  So, instead, I fill a large (4 cup, tall and narrow) measuring cup and then just dump it into the reservoir.  3 2/3 cups makes exactly 6 cups of brewed coffee as measured on the coffee carafe.  Yes, you could use the pot to measure the water, but it is a bit awkward to try and pour into the reservoir at the back of the coffee maker.

The brewing process is fast, effective on regular and the coffee tastes just fine. I see no difference from my older model.

The coffee I make tastes good, and although occasionally I do get grounds in my mug in the last cup in the pot, it is not as frequently as my Cuisinart makers.  I don't have issues with the amount of water I put in as other reviewers have mentioned because I use the pot itself to measure the amount of water needed.  I have had this coffee maker for six months now, and it consistently works unlike those from Cuisinart.  It turns itself off at the time i preset, and I like that you can have it warming for 5 hours instead of only 4 like others.  I have one major complaint about this coffeemaker.  The carafe needs to be redesigned.  When I pour water into the water reservoir, it inevitably spills no matter how slowly I pour it.  I believe it is the carafe, and not because I have to raise the entire lid as other reviewers have noted.  The reason I make that statement is that it also spills when I am pouring coffee into my coffee mug after brewing.  Slowing down how quickly I pour it does help, but it is still a problem that Braun should address with its newer models.  I did not purchase the model with an automatic grinder for whole beans.  I am curious to know if Braun makes such a model and what they think of it as I would prefer to use whole beans rather than ground coffee.","The coffee I make tastes good, and although occasionally I do get grounds in ...",Amazon,2

First, the water tank setup is small and due to its placement and the lid it's hard to fill the tank without dripping water all over. Not to mention I got sick of filling the tank nightly.. I wish it had a bigger water tank to store water in. Another issue-- coffee grounds would collect on the inside of the lid and needed cleaned off almost daily, and the grooves in the lid for the water holes made it nearly impossible to get it 100% clean. I've owned this for around 2 weeks and there is already a crack in the carafe. The coffee never got super hot, no matter how long it sat on the warmer, and it takes what feels like forever to make a full pot of coffee and with no pause brew feature, that means waiting a good 20 minutes if not more to enjoy the coffee.

Smooth tasting and nice and hot right after brewing--you don't have to let it sit on the burner plate to get hot. I use the charcoal filters and I think that has a LOT to do with the great taste, but using them is optional. I have never cared for the gold tone filter that a lot of coffeemakers come with, so I just don't use it. I much prefer paper filters, and this takes the #4 cone filters. Easy to program, VERY nice, sleek design, and as another reviewer stated, the pot slides easily in and out--doesn't get hung up on the drip mechanism. It brews quietly, and it does not beep at all when starting or finishing. That never bothered me with my other coffeemakers, but I don't miss it either-lol. I know some people find the beeping to be annoying. The green LED light came on when it was time to clean, which in my case was five (5) weeks after I started using it, so I expect it to always be about the same. So when I clean it, that's when I change the charcoal filter--makes it easy to keep track of. A lot of people will be able to go longer than 5 weeks, but I have VERY hard water. I used vinegar, not a commercial cleaner, and it works great. This is replacing a Mr. Coffee that was really great--for the whole 4 1/2 years that it worked!

It just makes it so simple to get it set right off the bat, you can't go wrong. I also want to mention that I do not prefer the included gold basket, I like paper filters. The coffee with the basket was more bitter than I care for. The paper filter filter eliminated that for me. Although another person reviewed the maker and mentioned the water reservoir has a small opening and the bright green water meter is hard to read, I do somewhat agree, but you will figure out a way to get down your water procedure because once you get this on your counter I bet you won't want to return it for this reason.

After doing research and reading the reviews, it seemed this would be the wisest choice for my needs: a programmable unit, one that allows for distinctions in taste, heat, and quantity of cups made, one that would disassemble and clean easily, and one that would allow me to continue to buy ground coffee and jazz it up with cinnamon sticks, vanilla beans, or whatever I like in the brew basket. So far, this unit is proving itself as a worthy successor to my beloved one of twenty years ago. Mine makes a great cup whether it be one or twelve, it makes it to spec with easy programming (I like mine bold and hot, and yes, my coffee comes out bold and hot without having to add extra coffee), and it is easy to disassemble and clean. It does come with a charcoal filter that one may use (its use is recommended). I use the charcoal filter but also I use distilled water as the water in my location is somewhat hard.

564,Braun,"August 29, 2016","Braun KF7150BK Brew Sense Drip Coffee Maker, Black",B01EA5ZHIA,5,"After searching extensively for an automatic drip coffee maker that was reasonably priced, I went with this product.  The reason I chose this product was for the design, features and price.  I prefer a cone type filter vs. basket as I believe it provides a better tasting coffee and makes more efficient use of coffee.  The price was on the higher end of what I was hoping to pay, but I also wanted a solid product since I brew daily. Set up was easy and pretty straight forward.  One difference from previous makers that I have owned is activating the brewing is separated from turning the machine on.  I'm used to activating the brew with a single button and this model requires two different functions, which isn't a problem, but just something different than what I've seen in previous makers that I've owned. The maker has a single lid that opens at the top to fill the grounds and water.  The water reservoir has a bright green water marker placed in steps to show water levels; includes a specific marker for the Braun travel mug.  The cone for grounds clicks in and out very firmly for discarding used grounds (I use paper filters vs. the included gold tone perma filter). Also, the water filter is easily accessible via a pull out stick type mechanism that sits firmly on the left of the reservoir. The clock and auto timers are easy to set - just like a typical alarm clock.  Additional features include boldness of coffee and hot plate temperature.  I have not yet tried out the different boldness settings as I like my coffee strong and set it to bold for my initial brews.The decanter is better than I've had in the past as it is virtually drip free.  I poured with the lid up and down and noticed how it poured very cleanly without dripping outside the reservoir. I ran one cycle of water to clean out the machine and noticed the very quiet cycle of the machine.  My first pot of coffee was rich and hot with no plastic or weird taste.  The automatic shut off worked just fine and there was no issue with scorched decanter/coffee.  Overall, I'm very happy with the Braun and the coffee this machine has been brewing.  I may need to adjust the strength as it's been stronger than I'm used to with my previous machine.","Good Value, Great Coffee",Amazon,202

I have the plate set on high and, while coffee could always be hotter, this one is by far the hottest I've had.  It does a great job at squeezing the most flavor out of coffee, no matter what coffee I used the product seems to make it just a little richer and fuller.  It takes getting used to because it will take the boldest grinds to a higher level and it might be a bit too much for some.  I set mine on 'bold' so just changing brew strength back to 'regular' did the trick with bolder coffee.

Unless you are pouring already made coffee in there I dont even see how one can tell what it says .  How hard would it have been to put a translucent window on the side of the holding tank ??  I mean such a seemingly benign oversight makes for such a YUUUGE hastle cause the carrafe and the tank water levels never correspond.

She faithfully brews tasty coffee and allows pouring during brewing. I haven't pushed all her buttons yet, but it's only a matter of time. I didn't even realize about the self-cleaning/descaling feature, which will eliminate a major hassle; I never was able to get all the white gunk out of my old six-cup Hamilton Brewstation, no matter how much powder coffee cleaner and vinegar I used and even though I only used filtered water in the tank. I hate to go all Donald Trump and trade in a fading companion whose looks are going, but it had to be done.

614,Braun,"July 24, 2016","Braun KF7150BK Brew Sense Drip Coffee Maker, Black",B01EA5ZHIA,4,"I purchased this coffee maker to replace a classic Braun Brewmaster after 20 years of use. For what I want out of a cup of coffee it is difficult to find a coffeemaker with the simplicity of design, ease of care and use, and reliable brewing as the old Braun but, alas I could only find that model in 220v with a four month wait on shipping. This Braun model delivers the same baseline features along with some nice but, for me, unnecessary bells and whistles: digital clock/ timer; elaborately stepped water level indicator. A couple minor design gripes: water reservoir is not centered at the backside like the older model but rather on the right hand side in a smaller configuration so it is a bit difficult to pour water in. Also, you have to have an almost directly aerial view to see the water level indicators. The cofee maker itself is about 12-14' tall which easily fits under standard cabinets but opening the large lid (maybe 7' square) requires pulling the unit out from under cabinets. In researching a new maker I liked the feature on another brand where you could remove the water reservoir to fill. Ultimately, though, these details were outweighed for me by the major plus: coffee is kept hot by glass carafe resting on a heating element as opposed to a thermally insulated carafe. And ditto on other reviewers comments about the cone and charcoal filtration. This Braun Brew Sense is solidly built, has clean Braun design, and makes good, hot coffee at a reasonable price.",Classic Braun design makes great cup of coffee,Amazon,20

Lots of water simply evaporate instead of to drip over the grinds.  We need to add an 'extra cup' of water to get the coffee done.  Now we ordered another coffee maker.  Apparently the new generation of makers, mostly 'Made in China', last for max 1 to 1.5 years. We look back at several makers (Krups, Capresso, Braun), all died in short succession. Like an 'extra cost for coffee', pity though of the additional load of plastics and metals to the landfills.  Prior to that, our great Braun KF590E lasted for almost 10 years, and so did a Krups before that.  Ah well, new times of 'perishable appliances'. Original opinion: We were delighted to spot a Braun at Best Buy.  After years of pause, we have again a Braun Coffee maker!  Ever since the iconic brand changed hands from Gillette to Procter and Gamble, who in their 'infinite wisdom' dumped household devices and sold them to De Longhi, the brand has vanished from our kitchens.  Remained lots of memories of ergonomically ingenious small appliances, which served for years.  Many Braun's stand worldwide in best Museums of Modern Art.  Such was the impact of their way of thinking and design philosophy.  What we take for granted today, was often introduced by this company. We like the new device!  We like its function, its looks, and foremost: the taste of the coffee which it makes.  We love the diversified warm plate settings!  But: why only one flap atop of the maker?  Why?  This simply does not make sense.  Its almost like these Cuisine Art's, which we disliked so much. Why do I have to (by mistake) pour some cold water over coffee grinds? Why do I have to (by mistake) drop some grinds into the water container? And, of course one single flap is larger, thus the machine needs more vertical space, what may or may not be an issue in some cases.  We are really glad to see the makers back in the US, we would just hope that Braun would make the small design change and provide a separate flap to the water container.",Dead after 16 months of service.,Amazon,0

621,Braun,"July 19, 2016","Braun KF7150BK Brew Sense Drip Coffee Maker, Black",B01EA5ZHIA,3,"I'm still getting used to this machine. We had a HB brewstation brand for a while but I was ready for something a little better. We drink a pot of coffee a day, and sometimes 2 a day on weekends. I'm not a coffee snob...but I'd say I'm squarely middle of the road where I don't want to pay a lot for coffee (sorry Keurig) but I want coffee that tastes good (again...sorry Keurig). It's always hard to find that balance. For this machine we have to keep it on BOLD brew and high temp for it to be as hot as I want it first thing in the morning. Why did I dock two stars? First, the controls are needlessly complicated. It seems strange to have a power button, a brew button, AND an auto on and auto off button. My HB brewstation already knew that I didn't care to turn it on and let it sit there, NOT brewing a pot of coffee. Just seems like a bit more thought could have been put into the controls. They look sleek & modern across the front of the machine, so maybe that was the reasoning behind it. Second, I still can't figure out how to NOT get grounds in the brewed coffee. I've used the provided gold mesh filter alone, a disposable cone filter alone, and both of them together. The disposable works the best of those 3 options, but there's still more grounds in the coffee than I'd like. Maybe this is because of how much coffee we put in to get it to the strength we like. Honestly, the box is still sitting in my living room cause I'm not sure if I'll return this or not. I like the look of it and the overall function, just need to determine if the quirks are something I'll be ok living with or if its going to drive me crazy in another six months.

So far, no disappointments in either department. The cone-shaped permanent filter is very nice and there is also a water filter as well. The coffee filter fits nicely into its slot, just rotate it and it snaps right in. This coffee maker has an anti-drip system, meaning that you can remove the carafe before the coffee has finished making and it will pause until you put the carafe back into place.

The latest one had a heating element problem so we would unplug it before leaving the house and after using it for the day.  The unit was nice because it stores hot water in a tank in back so you can make coffee in about three minutes in the morning.  We needed to do something different and right away before we burnt the house down, so when I saw this come across Vine I decided to give it a shot.

It has a timer on it so you can set the time when you want the unit to turn on.  The coffee can be ready when you get to the kitchen in the morning.  I’m always in a hurry so this is great. There are lots of plusses with this machine.  You can brew as much or as little coffee as you want.

We have filtered water in the house but there’s also an indicator for setting the hardness of the water so you know when to clean the unit up well. Supposedly this unit can even go in the dishwasher on the top shelf, but I always wash things like this by hand.  Now adding to all this, you can even set the warming plate at the bottom to three different temps.  I don’t think they left anything out when engineering this coffee pot. You can use the nice filter basket with this, or use the cone shaped filters, whichever you prefer.  This coffeemaker is beautiful and seems to be made well and I can understand the manual.

Note this is the same internally as the Cuisinart Brew Central DCC-1200, right down to the stair stepped cup indicator in the water tank (though Cuisinart's is marked more clearly).  This one has the water filter holder in the same place (and it's the same exact one supplied with the Cuisinart unit, as is the gold-tone coffee filter), but the design is somewhat different.  It adds a month indicator on the 'arm' so you know when to replace the filter, but its shape is square at the bottom so it's not as clear which direction the filter goes in (flat side up, rounded side down).  The Cuisinart unit's equivalent piece is rounded at the bottom so it's pretty clear that's the direction the water filter goes in.

There should be an upgraded version available where the glass carafe is replaced with a thermal carafe so your coffee isn't sitting on the burner to stay hot (it cooks the coffee over time and gives it an off taste, whereas if you were to transfer it when just finished brewing to a thermal carafe, it could stay hot and fresh-tasting for 2-3 hours [I use an Alfi 'Juwel' carafe for this, and it's exceptional, but probably more than most want to spend, and a thermal carafe option would save time cleaning]).

Other than these mild quibbles, I didn't really even have to read the manual much (but do soak that filter as recommended first), even to set the clock and timer (speaking of which, you will have to depress the SET button for longer than you think you will before the clock readout numbers starting flashing, indicating you can then change them, and when you do, you can only change them in one direction, so if you miss your hour or minutes you'll have to go all the way around again to set the clock properly).

This Braun coffee maker does good, hot coffee! The design is sleek and elegant, and it fits on the kitchen countertop under the upper cabinets. My last coffee maker didn't, so that was a consideration for me, too. This Braun coffee maker has a built-in water filter, which is a nice feature... if I remember to buy more filters. If not, the filter is optional and I can just use pre-filtered water in it. I appreciate both features as I want to use filtered water (chlorine does not make for good-tasting coffee), but inevitably forget to order new filters for whatever gadget it is I have that needs them. The place to pour in the water is somewhat unclear at first look, so do check through the directions, as you will find out immediately and messily -- as I did -- if you pour the water into the wrong hole. Brew strength selector, and temp change selector for base heater both good. Timer for presetting brewing also good. I haven't tried the cleaning function yet. The burner to keep the pot of coffee warm turns off much sooner than I would expect. It does keep the coffee from scorching, but I do end up microwaving to warm up from cup #2 onward.

Hit it lightly on edge of gas range burner, and it shattered into pieces. Surprised to find it so fragile. Expensive and not worthwhile to replace carafe only. Like the boxy design.  Fits nicely on the counter under a cabinet.  Easy to program and set.  The cone filter and space is plenty big enough to put in enough grounds for 12 cups of coffee without worrying about overflow.  The carafe lid is a bit flimsy and comes off easily.  My biggest beef is that the cord is too short.  Upside is there won't be extra cord hanging out across your counter.  Downside is that when you go to pull the coffeemaker out from under the cabinet to fill it, it doesn't stretch as far as you need it to in order to tip the lid all the way back.

As it turns out, they not only make coffee makers but hand blenders and countertop blenders in which seems to be the introduction of The Braun Kitchen Collection. As I am writing this review, this coffee maker model KF7000BK is not even for sale. It is not even to be found on Braun website! These are my impressions after using this machine for a week: - Unpacking was very simple, and in a couple of minutes, the machine was ready to be used. There is a water filter that you are supposed to soak for about 15 minutes (like Brita filters). You do not have to use it if you don't want to, but it is recommended. You can also choose the hardness of your water, which is a convenient feature if you live in an area where the water is especially hard. - The first time you use this machine, you are supposed to brew 12 cups of water with no coffee. This is the same process you would follow as if the machine had not been used for more than a couple of months. - One of my favorite features so far is the 1-4 cup setting. If you do not want to brew 12 cups of coffee, you select this and you will get the same flavor as if you were making the full cycle. This is convenient and effective because I found out that with other brands, when you do not brew 12 cups, the quality of the coffee suffers. - The machine has a 24 hour timer, so you can go to bed and wake up with your coffee ready to enjoy! Braun has another model, KF7150BK which lets you adjust between regular/bold coffee. It also has a setting to keep your coffee low/medium/warm temperature. I don't know the price of that other model, but those two features would not be worth paying extra money. Finally, the quality of coffee: I like it. It gives consistent good quality American coffee. Bear in mind, though, that this will depend on the quality of coffee you use, and of course, your own personal taste.

657,Braun,"May 26, 2016","Braun KF7150BK Brew Sense Drip Coffee Maker, Black",B01EA5ZHIA,1,"We’re impressed with the Braun KF7000 coffeemaker.  It can start brewing immediately with just a touch of one button or start/stop times can be programmed in.  The appliance automatically keeps coffee warm for two hours before shutting off, but again, it can be programmed to stay warm for as short as 15 minutes or as long as 5 hours. We like having the option of easy simplicity or timed programming, and I do notice much better flavor than what our last three coffee makers produced.  Even though we have model KF7000, which does not have an adjustable strength setting (model KF7030 does), coffee is always robust and hot throughout its entire two hour warming cycle.  It does not taste bitter the longer it sits either.  I ask only three things from a coffee maker—good taste, stays hot and has a no-drip carafe while pouring.  This Braun model comes through with flying colors. As an added bonus, this appliance comes with a gold-tone cone filter and has a self-cleaning cycle.  I’m not sure that cycle is much different than actual coffee brewing cycles, but I clean it according to manufacturer directions, and we’ve had no problems.  When descaling is necessary, an LED green light remains lit above the “clean” button on the appliance's face panel.  We use our coffee maker on a daily basis; the green clean light first came on in about a month's time.  Braun recommends their descaling solution, but any can be used, and so can a vinegar/water solution, which is what I use. Braun BrewSense also comes with a charcoal water filter, but we have opted not to use one since we have well water which isn’t hard and has little to no impurities like chlorine.  It also has a 1-4 cup button, but I have noticed no flavor difference by using that setting or by simply pressing the “brew” button.  All removable parts are dishwasher safe—carafe & lid, filter basket and gold-tone filter. UPDATE:  We used this coffee pot on a daily basis for thirteen months.  One morning we smelled something burning, and finally traced it to the Braun unit, which also showed E02 on its display.  We looked that up in the manual—Braun customer service needs to be contacted in the event of code problems.  Support was courteous and more than helpful.  Because this coffee pot has a two-year warranty, a new one was immediately shipped out.  Other than this one major fluke, we have had no problems with the machine.  The replacement arrived quickly, and we’re good to go again.  Don’t immediately discard your old machine if you should find yourself in a similar situation.  Braun requires the electrical cord be cut from the non-functioning unit and mailed to them as proof of purchase. SECOND UPDATE:  I can no longer recommend this product.  The replacement coffee maker had the exact same issue as our first one--one day (after about six month's use) there was a terrible burning smell and the error code E02 on display.  We've gone through two of these now in less than two year's time, and we only turn the pot on once in the mornings.  We've used coffee pots for the past 40 years, and have never had a problem like this.  Who wants a dangerous appliance in their home?  We sure don't.

They know how to put quality parts into aesthetically pleasing products that are efficient. The cone filtration system is so much better than the flat basket system. It uses gravity to deliver the same water pressure evenly. Wider at the top with a greater amount to push through, narrow at the bottom where a flat system fizzles out. The water delivery system is a top down sprinkler, instead of that side swivel that only wets 1/2 the grounds. The water is distributed evenly so that if you want a specific amount, instead of the full brew, you can be assured that it'll be perfect. Plus, there are those florescent green steps inside for easy water measuring. The gold basket is much better than what I've used in the past. There is a little coffee sludge at the bottom still, but about a 1/2 teaspoon instead of what covered the bottom of the carafe in the old system. And, the acid taste is pretty much gone. It's as close to a paper filter as ever. My only complaint is that the clock is teeny tiny. Being a kinda tall guy, I find myself bending way over and squinting to look at it. But, I seldom use the clock except for setting the auto on function which needs to be done once. The overall concept of a coffee maker with a timer at that price range is standard.

660,Braun,"May 25, 2016","Braun KF7150BK Brew Sense Drip Coffee Maker, Black",B01EA5ZHIA,5,"The first coffee maker I had was a Braun Brewmaster, a graduation gift from my Mom's best friend. At the time it was considered the best made, but I didn't use it correctly.  It needed to be plugged in all the time to maintain a tank of water at optimal temperature, and I was in a dorm room with one outlet.  Since then I have been through a lot of coffeemakers.  My favorite thus far, a Krups, lasted just 6 months, like their burr grinder.  That was an expensive 6 months.  I did replace it with another Krups, this time a pretty generic drip which worked OK, but was nothing special, and was very plastic. This Braun does not need to heat the water in advance to work (though now I have dedicated counter space) ;)  It is a nice looking machine, polished black and chrome.  It is programmable with a handful of simple and useful settings.  You can set a time to brew, choose regular strength or bold and whether or not you want the warming plate on (which can be set for up to 5 hours).  It has a shower head style nozzle which distributes the water over the grounds.  The only thjing I might like better is a thermal carafe. (I do not think coffee which sat on a warming plate for 5 hours would be very good).  It never lasts that long around here, but it was nice to be able to sleep in this morning and find hot coffee when I woke up.  I won't say it is the best coffee I have ever had.  I prefer plunge pots, but generally do not have the wherewithall  to mess with it first thing in the morning.  This works.  It is simple, clean, looks nice on the counter and makes a good cup of coffee.  I think the keep warm feature will get tested when my parents come to visit...

661,Braun,"May 25, 2016","Braun KF7150BK Brew Sense Drip Coffee Maker, Black",B01EA5ZHIA,5,"My husband is the coffee expert in our family and he says this Braun KF7150BK is five stars all the way. Edit 7/7/17:  Because of a question asked I had my husband brew a pot of coffee this morning while I watched this pot work its magic.  You can read the entire experiment in the comment section.  Short answer, the decorative top is made with dimples, not holes.  There is steam which escapes all along the lid back seam.  The product description states that all condensation stays inside the pot.  Well, that's correct because the DROPS of condensation never leave the pot -- STEAM does.  I have not changed the original review so you can see where I made the incorrect statement.  Resume original review. The manual is easy to read and actually helpful.  (This isn't always the case with some brands.) LED control panel is actually easy to read. There is an honest to goodness on/off switch.  (I know, isn't that just crazy??) There is a setting for brewing a small pot, between 1-4 cups. You can set the coffee strength between regular and bold. The warming plate has three temperatures.  Yes, count them, low, medium, or high and they work. There is a 60-second built in back-up for saving your settings if you have a power glitch like we have a lot. The lid comes off the glass carafe so you can put both pieces in the dishwasher. You can indicate the hardness of your water and get a reminder of when you need to descale the unit. Plus.......this thing is just plain gorgeous sitting on the kitchen counter. Interestingly enough, as well as all the things previously listed, the coffee maker also makes a darn good cup of coffee.  It is just a little bit loud to me, not to my husband.  It brews quickly, less than five minutes for the 'short pot' which is the size we usually make.  You can take a quick cup before the brew cycle finishes.  The temperature of the finished first cup is hot (just right for hubby who likes it practically scalding).  An interesting little tidbit from the manual is that the coffee will have better flavor balance if you stir the coffee after it has finished the brew cycle.  According to the manual, the strongest coffee results from the first water through the grounds so stirring will even out the strength in the finished pot.  The automatic timer and clock are easy to set and also easy to read because the numerals are a good size.  You can use either the permanent 'gold' filter included with the machine or use paper filters. Now, the only aspect you might want to consider before you purchase this unit:  the top of the machine is perforated and while this looks very attractive, it results in a lot of hot steam coming out of the top and the back of this unit.  Be careful that you have enough room around the coffee maker so that steam has someplace to go and not just into the finish of your kitchen cabinet.  I like for this unit to have plenty of air circulation around it when we are using it.  We just pull it forward out from under the shelf above it and then push it back (on those very nice non-skid feet) out of the way when it is not in use.",This feels like we got a top-of-the-line luxury model.,Amazon,235

One nice feature of the unit—it has an optional screen you can use that makes the purchase of separate filters unnecessary. (Though you can still use paper filters if you like.) Another neat feature—especially for tea drinkers like me—is that it has three temperature settings. Some teas require different settings. For instance, a Mate should use a lower temperature than an Herbal tea. Also, the decanter on this unit pours better than our previous coffeemaker, meaning it is a lot harder to spill.

Update: We've been using this for about a week and the whole family loves it. Having a 12-cup capacity means we don't need to make as many pots, which is great -- the pot lasts a while. The coffee tastes very good, and using the water filter means we can just fill with water from the tap, which is convenient. The machine has a smaller-than-expected footprint -- especially nice because counterspace is at a premium! Also, this may seem trivial, but the spout on the carafe works well; there's no spillage when I fill the water reservoir. VERY nice coffeemaker, well designed, as one would expect from Braun. Probably the weakest point is the warming platform, which doesn't get very warm though I haven't yet quantified its effectiveness. Right now it takes 10 minutes to brew a full pot of 12 cups, though I expect that will increase as mineral deposits accumulate. Operation is fairly intuitive, though there is also a manual. Some parts are dishwasher safe. Update: Been using this for about a year and still love it -- great coffeemaker.",attractive 12-cup coffee brewer with timer and keep-warm platform,Amazon,5

The timer works well and the water stays where you want it (in EVERY sense of the word) for as long as you want it to. Having said that, I have to confess that, although I go through a MINIMUM of two pots a day, I am hardly a gourmet in this area; more of a gourmand. Indeed, to my mind the single greatest improvement of any of these coffee makers is the doohickey (which one will vary with brand) that allows you to pour a cuppa while the brewing is still going on!

I think it brews a bit too hot and also I don't know if the water pours over the grounds the way it should so my coffee will taste thin and watery at times in spite of the color being about right.  If you're not that picky on your coffee this may work but now that I've compared it side-by-side with my new 5-cup Bonavita, this Black & Decker is back into the box and out in the garage storage cabinet.  I'll update this if I get a chance to experiment with it more. I needed a new coffee maker in a hurry because my fairly nice DeLonghi was 'steaming it's brains out' after 4 years of use.  I owned a Black and Decker 10-12 cup coffee maker back in my single days and it worked well and lasted a long time. I picked up a nearly identical unit (model# CM0700B) Black and Decker at a local bargain chain retailer since I needed it immediately.  The only difference between mine (CM0700B) and this one (CM0700BZ) featured here is that mine doesn't have the included permanent coffee filter basket (shown here on Amazon) so I have to use paper filters or buy a permanent gold basket filter from Amazon.  That being said, this is a pretty good compact coffee maker that mostly brews good tasting coffee if you use quality whole beans and know what you're doing.  It looks aesthetically pleasing to the eye, especially for the cost.  The glass carafe isn't thin glass and appears durable.  It pours cleanly from the carafe without spilling.  The hot plate kept my coffee hot for an hour or more and somehow it didn't end up with that burnt taste.  I used my Breville Burr Grinder set for 5 cups and used 3 1/4 cups of filtered water to get the bold Euro brew I love. It only took about 10 minutes to brew compared with the 45 minutes that my now deceased DeLonghi took.  All-in-all, this was a good short-term solution until my new Bonavita 5-Cup Coffeemaker arrives for Christmas (a gift I'm soon to receive from a relative).  I've been dying to own a Bonavita but couldn't justify buying one until my DeLonghi took it's final steam bath.",A Good Value Coffeemaker with a Small Footprint...,Amazon,0

A few notes from my first week: One or two reviews commented that the coffee wasn't hot enough. These people must have tongues of steel because I definitely need to let my drink cool down for about 5 minutes after pouring it or my mouth will get scorched. About the reusable basket. I agree that it should be cone shaped-style as opposed to the flat style, and it's strange to me that there's only mesh on the sides and not the bottom. It still gets the job done just fine though. And seriously people, it's too hard to clean? It takes approximately 30 seconds to clean out the mesh filter and pop in back into place. Save some paper! About the warped top. My parents have the old model of this coffee maker and that top definitely would warp when it was brewing. So far, I haven't noticed any warping on the lid of this model, and the plastic seems much heavier/stronger than the old model. I don't think it will warp, but will update if any issues arise. Finally, about the coffee strength. I do notice that this coffee seems a little weaker than my old coffee maker. I'm not sure if this is because a) the coffee grinds I'm using is different from my previous brand b) the mesh filter's flat style doesn't work as well as a conical style/paper filter or c) I just haven't found the sweet spot of grounds:water yet. Overall, if you read through all this, you're overthinking it! This is a solid $20 coffee maker and if you hate it get another one after a year or two. EDIT: Update, 11/26. As far as the coffee strength goes, the initial weak coffee taste I noticed was definitely from the grounds and not the maker. Since buying a better brand of grounds, my morning coffee comes out strong and hot!",Does the job for cheap,Amazon,4

No extra shopping for filters! * The carafe is THICK and HIGH quality. Has a good handle, easy to grip and pour. No dribbling with your pour. * Super simple operation!  ONE button! * Heated hot plate to keep your coffee warm. Mind you it does NOT shut off on its own. * No expensive pods! This coffee maker uses regular ground coffee! * 5 cups is the perfect compromise!  Minimal waste but enough for two. It's slightly taller than the 4 cup MR Coffee model. This Black and Decker model is only slightly shorter than a standard 12 cup coffee maker. Overall, I would buy the Black and Decker 5 cup over the Mr. Coffee 4 cup.",5 cups is the perfect compromise!,Amazon,0

I use it on my desk at work. I brew right into my coffee mug, then the hot plate will keep my coffee hot as I slowly drink it over the course of a few hours :) :) :).  FYI my mug is just a cheap mug from W-Mart and it has not shattered yet.  Just a few things people need to know about this coffee maker. 1.  If you make it in your coffee mug make sure you push it back all the way or sometimes the drip stopper does not always open. 2.  It Does not make super hot coffee so either wait 10-15 mins like I do or just microwave it for 30 seconds. 3.  I use paper filters it seems to make a better tasting coffee to me anyway, it also easier to toss it in the Garbage then having to clean the reusable filter it comes with. 4.  If the Lid starts to warp (has not happened to me yet, but has happened to others reviewers.). I will just put a book about the size of a school math book on top. After a few uses, it should go back to normal. ( this worked on my cheapo coffee maker while in college. 5. REMBER!!! the burner does NOT have an auto-OFF feature. It will cook anything left on it if you forget. (i like having an on/off switch because I take a while to drink my coffee.) If I have any issues with the coffee make i will update this review at a later date. 5/2/2018 update: I figured out how to get a good HOT mug of coffee right off the bat, instead of waiting for 10 15 mins for it to heat up in the mug If I just pre-heated my mug in the microwave with water or very hot water from the sink.

We at Spectrum Home Appliances understand that there have been various reports and articles in recent months and years that raise concerns about Bisphenol A (BPA) in consumer products and the impact of such reports and articles on the purchase of certain products by consumers.  In such reports and articles, the clear focus is on the potential hazards posed by the migration of BPA from food and beverage containers into food and beverages consumed by humans and by direct ingestion or mouthing of plastic items by infants and children. Specifically and by example, the draft NTP Brief on Bisphenol A (BPA) released by the National Toxicology Program of the National Institutes of Health report states, 'the vast majority of bisphenol A exposure is through the diet ~ 99%'  For products that specifically claim to be BPA-Free, the plastics and resin that comes into direct contact with food and beverage are made of Polypropylene material, silicone or other plastic materials, all of which are BPA free. Other parts of the product which do not come into contact with food or beverage may contain BPA in some of the plastics and resins that are used. For products that do not claim to be BPA-Free, we have insufficient information to support a BPA-Free claim at this time. So it wasn't really an answer because I still don't know if the parts that come in contact with the hot water or the coffee grounds are BPA free?  So I guess it may not be great if the manufacturer doesn't know whether the parts are BPA-free? I did receive the little coffee maker yesterday.  It is adorable.  Works well.  The material does not look cheap but it is a little lighweight probably due to its size.  Makes really good coffee.  The glass carafe seems to be of good quality although the lid to the carafe is not.  The cord was not coiled when I received it so am wondering if it was returned by another customer.  Although it looked and smelled new.  There is no really bad plastic smell as other reviewer stated.  It did have a little plastic odor though so I ran water/vinegar solution through it and then rinsed twice with plain water.  Smell for the most part is gone.  I am still just concerned about the exposure to BPA.  Any thoughts from someone who might be reading this long review?",BPA,Amazon,27

This one looks great in our kitchen.  It makes 5 cups of coffee - some of the other small ones only make 4.  You can remove the carafe and pour a cup while it is still brewing.  This model also DOES have the warmer plate to keep the coffee warm.  However the warmer plate will remain ON until you turn the coffeemaker off - it does not auto shutoff.  The temperature of the coffee is just right, i can add refrigerator cold cream/milk and sweetener to my coffee and the coffee is still hot to drink which is great.  The ONLY thing I did not like, was when we used the coffee maker it would have a really bad burning plasticky smell after brewing coffee.  At first we thought that would wear off after the first 3 brews.  But it did not. The bad plasticky smell was bad enough to smell up our whole kitchen.  We ended up running 3 cycles of half vinegar and half water through it - like you would do when you descale it.  Then another clean water only cycle.  That seemed to do the trick and got rid of the bad plasticky smell.  So now we are very happy with this little coffee maker. Pros: looks great - nicer than a lot of other small coffee makers brews coffee well and keeps it warm to a good temperature lid on carafe is easy to take off for cleaning!! cons: ours initially had a bad plastic smell when we used it - that took some cleaning cycles to get rid of - for this reason i am deducting one star.","great size for 2, takes up less space",Amazon,17

So if you feel you'll drink more than that, this coffee pot may not be the ideal choice. I encourage going bigger if you think you'll need to make a lot more often. Otherwise, for a few average size cups, this pot is ideal for. I'll admit that I sometimes make a second pot when my husband is off from work and drinking coffee too. I like how easy this pot is to use. I simply place the coffee grounds ( I use 5-6 tablespoons for a full pot) in the filter, pour the water in the designated area, and flip the on switch. A pot is made in less than ten minutes! The permanent grounds filter saves me money and encourages the waste-free lifestyle I'm aiming for. It was part of the season I opted for this pot. There's a Sneak-a-Cup Feature which allows you to pour a cup before the brewing time is fully complete. I execute this feature often and it's never spilled over or down. It's essentially a mess-free way to fill that coffee craving if you just can't any longer. Believe me, somedays it's really needed to do so. There is one switch which serves as the off and on. The button emits a bright blue light that's noticeable. There's no auto-off feature but the button is catching enough to serve as a reminder to shut it off when you are done. ' My husband and I usually use a french press but often enough people gift us ground coffee that we can't make in that. Having a coffee pot to enjoy the coffee instead of returning or turning away the gift is much more preferred.

Those who say the coffee maker is too small aren't reading the title. It DOES say it's a 5 cup coffee maker! Naturally it will be small! For starters, I love the shape of the carafe. I actually did a search to FIND one like this! It pours so nice, like a pitcher. Most, you practically have to turn upside down to pour out the last of the coffee. The carafe does not fit tight, which is nice. I love the handle, most are rounded, and you can only fit 2-3 fingers in it to pour. You can use your whole hand with this one. I'm not a fan of permanent filter baskets, as you still have to dump the coffee grinds when you are done. I had some five cup filters and tried them on this coffee maker. They work, but are a bit too tall. So I went out and bought filters for a 4-cup maker. They fit perfect!!

The first thing I did was measure the water temperature, as in my experience the biggest drawback with this type of coffeemaker is their inability to heat the water correctly to brew good coffee.  This one came in at 198 degrees, which is a bit on the low side but hot enough to brew coffee correctly.  Time will tell if this stays solid; most coffeemakers use a thermocouple to control the temperature, and they wear out pretty quickly. It takes only a few minutes for the coffee to brew into the tiny pot, which is very nicely designed, easy to hold, and dripless to pour.  I really like that it came with a permanent gold-tone filter, since that’s usually the first accessory I want with a new coffeemaker and makes it even handier in settings such as a dorm room, since you don’t need to buy/store separate filters. I’m fussy about my coffee, and I think this is a very serviceable little coffeemaker.  Note that it does not have an automatic-off feature; you have to remember to turn it off when you’re finished.

So, if you want to give it a shot, it is a stress free option except the part making it fit the box. Packaging is a bit challenging to reverse-engineer. Possibly pros but useless to me: -The height of container slot is adjustable for different kinds of containers like putting a travel cup or single mug. -One of the modular pieces is supposedly to make pour over coffee. I am not sure why would you expect/use your drip coffee machine for that. Cons: -Unlike the lid, lower pieces, like the base under glass carafe that can be adjusted for different heights are flimsy, and felt like a toy than a kitchen appliance. -The unit is not much smaller than a regular 10-12 cups machine. Only slightly. The amount of kitchen counter space you save by buying a five cups machine is not considerable. Plus the inconvenience when you have a guest(s). Most regular machines have brewing options that allow you to make 3-4 cups instead of full capacity. -No drip off function. This was the deal breaker for me. It is listed in features. I have no idea why it did not work. Maybe mine was defected. I ordered this to replace my old rival coffee maker. It was the cheapest and most basic one you could get from Walmart and it had the drip-off function (just a spring between carafe and filter, it is not rocket science).

This went from box to making coffee in less than two minutes.  It is highly intuitive; if you have the slightest knowledge of how to work one of these things, you’re all set. There are no bells or whistles here; this is bare-bones coffee making, and not a lot of it at that.  But it gets the job done quickly and well, for a reasonable price. The item is 120V only. The entire coffee process takes less than five minutes.  It is relatively quiet as it’s brewing, and the blub-blub-blub on the empty water vessel makes it clear when it is done.  There are no beeps or indicators of any type. There are no displays or timers, either.  When you flip the on/off rocker switch button, it starts making coffee. Coffee: so, how does it taste?  This doesn’t make the finest cup of coffee you’ve ever had, nor does it make the worst.  It gets the job done just fine, a solid 5 on a 1-10 scale.  It makes all of 5 cups of coffee, so there is enough in there to fill your big go-cup on the way out for work. The integral filter basket gets the job done, but is not metal, nor is it very fine.  If you like your coffee with a lot of fiber, leave it at that. If you like a clearer, more highly filter coffee, you’ll need to get a paper filter insert, which is not included. If you just can’t wait for that first cup, this does have a feature to pull the carafe for up to 30 seconds, and brewing will stop.  After 30 seconds it resumes, so get that carafe back in position.  There is a warming plate at the bottom, which will keep the carafe warm.  If the coffeemaker is on, the plate will warm, so pay attention to what you’re doing and make sure you turn it off. Documentation: You get a dense and crowded user pamphlet, in English, Spanish, And French.  Right up top is a 800 customer care phone number, and a URL for customer service.  You get lots of safety warnings, and information on when to clean/descale the coffeemaker with vinegar.  There’s also a parts/accessories 800 number. Price: This is a nice easy approximately $20.  It arrives ready to go, and does exactly what it’s supposed to do.  This is a good price for this item, which is from a major manufacturer with a good reputation, and it comes with a two-year warranty. Bottom Line: this is an entry-level coffee maker, ideal for a single person or a dorm room.  It’s simple to use, and comes in at a really great price.","Simple Basic Automatic Coffee Maker, at a Good Price",Amazon,2

Both are 5 cups and make excellent coffee however I wish they could combine the best features and put them all into one machine. It seems each one omits a good feature that the other has and adds a new feature in place of the one they omitted! I like that this one has the 'Sneak-a-Cup' Feature That pauses the flow of coffee so you can get a cup before the entire pot finishes brewing  so you don't make a mess. The other one does not have this feature but it has a heated plate that keeps the coffee in the pot hot if it is just you drinking the whole '5' cups (they both actually only make 2 coffee mugs from the 5 cups of water you fill it with). And it has a slot that you can tuck the cord into if you want to keep your counter neater. This one comes with the reusable filter the DCM600B does not! You see what I mean... It is hard to say which one would be best for you. IF the keep warm/hot plate is a huge concern then go with the other one, if the pause to pur feature is your cup of tea, then get this one!

Thing is, if you make something simple, it needs to be spot-on.  This one, to me, the carafe handle is so overly large that it makes it look comical, and it's not very comfy to use (I have grip issues, so that probably contributes). Otherwise, it has a reusable filter, and I like that.  You can remove it if you care to use paper, but I like it.  I find the water reservoir to be easier to get to than usual.  It's simple to use, doesn't have a ton of bells and whistles, which is refreshing.  And the water reservoir window faces front, which makes it a lot easier to see and I like that, too.

After brewing, as long as you don't turn off the switch, the warmer will be active and keep your coffee hot. Original Review: If you need a one to two person coffeemaker, this Black and Decker coffeemaker may fit the bill. It's maximum capacity is 5 cups (40 oz) which is generally good enough for 2 Contigo coffee mugs. It takes about 7 minutes to brew the 5 cups. It's also a very easy to use coffeemaker (but honestly, none are ever too difficult). Just put the ground coffee in the filter and hit the blue button. The instructions recommend about 1 tablespoon per cup of coffee, but depending on the roast, I'd go a little less with dark and just about 1 per cup for the light roast. Black and Decker mad it very easily to clean as well. The filter and cup holding the filter can be taken right out for a quick wash. The reservoir also has an overflow mouth in the rear so be careful with overfilling it. In my experience, Black and Decker products are generally very reliable. The only negative comment I can note down is the lack of the 'keep warm' feature. Pros: - No disposable filters needed (but can be used if you remove the included reusable filter) - Easy to clean - Simple to use - Steal a cup Cons: - No keep-warm feature Additional info - It's always good to run the coffeemaker with water a couple of times before first use to clean out the plastic scent and taste. Even the instructions call for this.",Great little coffee maker,Amazon,1

845,BLACK+DECKER,"October 3, 2017","BLACK+DECKER 5-Cup Coffeemaker, Black, CM0700BZ",B072NDTS6F,4,"My husband and I have two  5 cup Mr. Coffees because he likes decaf and I like regular,  so every morning we have our own small pot of coffee. Comparing the two pots:  -This Black and Decker 5 cup in my opinion is a better coffee maker than the Mr. Coffee.  The coffee it produces is superior in taste.  Mr. Coffee tends to produce a bitter cup.  Don't even think about leaving the carafe on the warmer for even a couple of minutes or it will be so bitter I can't drink it.  I always jump up as soon as it's done and turn the machine off.  Side by side the B + D  appears to have a more efficient drip system which is completely different than the Mr. Coffee system. -The carafe  pours without dripping.  I can attest that one of the most annoying features about the Mr. Coffee carafe is that It drips on the counter unless you are extremely careful when pulling away from your cup pour. -The water chamber is also more convenient  to fill than Mr Coffee (There is a large space on the left)  That said,  the Black and Decker has a larger foot print than the Mr. Coffee as can be seen in attached photos. Brewing: The experts say that the perfect brew temp for coffee is 195-205 degrees.  Whether large capacity or small,  many electric pots exceed this temperature which produces bitter coffee verses a smooth enjoyable cup.  I took the liberty to temp the Black+Decker when my brew was finished for purposes of this review.  The temperature of the coffee was 198 degrees. I left the carafe on the warmer for 20 minutes and did another temperature test ( with my Thermapen thermometer which is super accurate..)  and the the temperature was 195 and coffee still tasted great.  Winner!  Especially for the price...it's an awesome cup of coffee. Note: To make my perfect cup I use a 2 tablespoon measuring spoon slightly heaping,  4 tablespoons total to 5 cups water on the carafe.  I like my coffee bold and flavorful but not super strong,  and it turns out perfect.  (I use cream) Photo 1. Mr. Coffee on left, Black + Decker on right  (both 5 cup capacity) Photo 2. Left/Mr. Coffee carafe,  Right/Black and Decker carafe Photo 3. Black + Decker drip mechanism.  It's much more substantial than Mr. Coffee's, and drops down closer to the coffee. Photo 4. Mr. Coffee's drip mechanism is smaller and closer to the top lid. UPDATE Dec 11, 2017:  Unfortunately the lid has warped and will no longer close,  so I removed  stars. This had to be due to the plastic not being able to take the heat from the drip mechanism.  I added a photo to illustrate.  (last photo) Dec. 16:  Have been using the pot nearly a week since my update and strangely  enough after making a pot of coffee this morning the lid has now returned  back to it's flat position and will close again.  In fairness I added all but one star back to my original rating since the coffee is so good.",The perfect cup of coffee in a tiny package.  Better than Mr. Coffee.

In my opinion, the height of the maker is as short as it can be while still working properly as a drip and also having a carafe that can pour properly. Don't get the wrong carafe. It's not worth saving a few bucks from here only to end up with a carafe that spills. Here are some pros and cons: Pros 1. No insidious clock that has to be set and reset. 2. Shape of the carafe works for pouring. Carafes are not all the same. 3. It actually makes way less than 5 cups. Better to make less coffee more frequently than lots in one go, I think. Cons 1. No auto-shutoff. 2. Does not make a true hot cup of coffee. I don't think any of the small bargain makers get hot enough. I give it 5-stars because it gets the minimal job done.

I love how simple the Keurig machines are to use and the ease of making many types of coffee one cup at a time. As for the reliability and customer service, I really have nothing good to say about this company anymore. I had my first K155 and it lasted about 11 months before it started with the 'short cupping'. After all the proper maintenance and expensive bottles of descaler, this was my result. When I finally got tired of pushing the brew button 2 or 3 times to make a cup of coffee, I contacted Keurig about my issue. Well, It turns out that I waited to long with the issue and my warranty ran out. Now mind you, this was  $300 at the time I purchased it. After weeks of emails and phone calls, they finally sent me this replacement. Because I was working overseas at the time, it has been in storage in the original box. I have since returned back to the USA and finally moved into my new house. I only have been using this now, the only person using it I might add, for three months. Only using bottled water and of course descaler and cleaned all the needles. It is AGAIN DOING THE SAME THING. 3 months use by a single person at 2 or 3 cups a day and bottled water, I should not be having these issues. So I decided to call customer service and explain what's happening. Their response after telling me to watch the videos online and try cleaning it again...... OH, I'M SO SORRY.... IT'S OUT OF WARRANTY. EVEN though it's been in my Storage unit and never having been used, they will do nothing for me. Very, very sad company.  I sure hope anyone else having this issue, leaves a one star review. In reality, I have a 3 month old Keurig that's having issues and they won't replace it.

I love the concept -pop in a pod and 60 seconds later you have a pretty good cup of coffee. I’ve bought 2 of the “consumer” machines. The first one failed just shy of the warranty and they replaced it. The replacement failed just after the warranty ran out so I bought another one which, wait for it, failed right after the warranty ran out. I was planning on going back to a “normal” coffee maker when I read the reviews here and on other site’s about the durability and longevity of the commercial units so I finally pulled the plug and bought the K155.  It’s a nice machine - clearly solid and more durable than the consumer machines. I’m loving the large reservoir and the solid ‘click’ of the metal pod holder. The quality of the coffee seems great so at the moment I’m quite happy. Only time will tell if this one holds up better/longer than my past experiences. It’s pretty bad when a machine in the Keurig price range fails so miserably after a year and a half but that seems to be fairly common regardless of how much you baby the thing with descaling/cleaning. I’m hoping to get years from this model. If not, I’m breaking up with Keurig and going back to the good old non-pod type maker. This is a pricey investment and they should have re-engineered their consumer systems to be tougher / last longer but sadly that’s not the case. I’m still in the fence about buying the direct water connect. Overall, it’s really a shame they can’t get the bugs out of a line of products they’ve been selling for years.

My first machine lasted 7 years, and I loved the coffee. After the first machine died (it just stopped turning on), I immediately purchased another. Over the years, it's become increasingly harder to get pods for the Tassimo, especially the Extra Bold line. I didn't want to be limited to only getting refills on Amazon, and also being limited to a very small variety of brands and flavors. I decided it was time for a change. Like many, I was initially unimpressed with Keurig. The machines seemed cheap, and many reviews have said that they only last for a year with daily use. I always found the Green Mountain brand pods to be exceptionally bitter, and the machines never produced really hot water (if you add cream/milk it will be luke-warm). Perhaps my views are jaded from bad experiences in the past, but I knew I wanted to get a commercial quality brewer and that's how I found the K155. Fast forward to today. I've been using the K155 for two weeks now and absolutely love it. It's heavy and seems to be built to take abuse. It holds 90oz of water, which reduces the frequency of refilling. There's about a 3 minute warm-up time in the mornings, but subsequent cups will be much faster. Using the machine is dead simple - just put in a pod, select your cup size, and hit brew. If you just want hot water, you can press brew without a pod inserted and the machine will dispense it. As for the coffee, it's been very good! Keurig includes a 12-pod variety pack with the brewer, and I've also purchased some more at the supermarket. I love the McDonalds McCafe French Roast - it's an incredibly smooth dark roast that is delicious with cream. My girlfriend loves the Donut Shop, which is a medium roast akin to Dunkin Donuts. For flavored coffee, the Cinnabon Cinnamon Roll is surprisingly good. For decafe, I've only tried Donut Shop so far, which I was also pleasantly surprised by. I'm not a huge fan of the design. It's very 'industrial' looking. While it has a large color LCD, it displays random pictures of coffee beans while brewing. I would have preferred a status bar like my second Tassimo had. But I can get past these minor gripes due to the fact that it makes good, hot coffee with a humongous assortment of varieties. I definitely recommend the K155 if you take your morning caffeination ritual seriously.",Best single-serve coffee brewer on the market,Amazon,4

Even though I was familiar with this model, I didn't realize that the screen did not have a fixed night light showing the time like some of the other Keurig models.  The constant screen rotation is very annoying to me, but that's my fault for not paying more attention. My main complaint is the heating element, it doesn't heat the coffee to the desired brew temperatures. In the settings,  I've turned the element temp all the way up to max (198*F) and after using a thermometer taking the temperature, both coffee and plain water as soon as brewed, it showed 175*F. I like my coffee very hot and this was never a problem with the same machine used at work. This was one of the reasons I went with is model, because it is more of a commercial quality machine that I hope will last over a longer period of time. I called Keurig and explained my problems and have to say they were very helpful by sending a new machine which just arrived. I haven't set it up yet, but plan to tomorrow and hope that at least the temperature issue is resolved. If that happens I'll be satisfied for for now and will have to see how this performs over the long run and will update my review.",Did not purchase from Amazon.,Amazon,0

Very easy set-up; we don't need or want 12 oz. cups or direct water hook up.  If I want a latte, I use the 4 oz. setting.  10 oz. setting is MORE than enough for a cup of coffee for us.  I debated over many different models and finally, decided on this one.  So far, I'm NOT sorry we got this one. * No plastic taste; no chemical taste. * One thing, you cannot set the 'strength' of the brew, if that matters to you. * The coffee/water is very hot!  You can reduce it, but we like it hot. * Reusable solo cups work fine, provided you modify them (1/2' flat, rubber washer in the top; 1/2' clean, bottom of used, k-cup pushed into bottom of reusable solo cup; make sure the hole in the bottom of the k-cup is not covered by the cross-bar on the bottom of the solo cup; use the paper filter; cut off the hinge). * I use a 'fine grind' on my conical burr grinder for my beans.  I pack it down a bit in the reusable solo cup and run a small, flat end of fork on the side for water flow. *I bought the Secura Milk Frother and I am loving my lattes!  I use a 4 oz. brew of coffee and I'm a VERY happy camper! * I previously, owned a Capresso, stand-alone steamer, but they don't make them any more.  I owned a big Jura Espresso machine with a built-in burr, bean grinder, a milk frother and I was spoiled, but this item is very, very nice.","HOT WATER!

1039,Keurig,"September 9, 2017","Keurig K155 Office Pro Coffee Maker Brewer, One Size, Silver",B00DWKEHU4,4,"If you're looking for a Keurig that is both quality material and impressive-looking, look no further than the K155! I'd like to start off by addressing the most common fault I've read in the reviews: The metallic/synthetic taste from the machine. This one is easy. First off, it's a brand new machine, folks -- straight from the factory (at least I would hope so at it's $200+ price tag) -- so this is something to be expected in its initial use. To clear this taste, follow these instructions: (1) Wash the reservoir with warm water. (2) Fill the reservoir with tap water, just below the Max line. (3) Add half cup of white wine vinegar. (4) Allow mixture to sit for up to thirty minutes. (5) Brew mixture through machine (mimic brewing several cups of coffee without adding a K-Cup). (6) When prompted to refill reservoir, refill to max line with plain tap water. (7) Brew this water completely through the machine to rid excess vinegar. (8) Now, when prompted to refill reservoir, rinse reservoir with warm tap water. (9) Refill with filtered water. (10) Enjoy your coffee (you're welcome). Additionally, each cup of coffee brewed after this method gets better and better. There are four (4) brew volume options: 4 oz, 6 oz, 8 oz, and 10 oz. Originally, this disappointed me, but I realize after being clever and brewing, say a 16 oz cup (8 oz, twice with the same K-cup), the coffee flavor is noticeably weakened. It has become clear by my experience that, for best quality and flavor, a single K-cup should not be brewed for greater than 10 ounces. Over the long-haul, that means Keurig-brewed coffee is far more expensive than the good ol' coffee grounds-in-filter-brewed coffee. On the grand scheme of things, however, choosing the less-expensive coffee machine means you (1) sacrifice convenience. Keurig K-cups are fast and easy, as there is no need to reach and fumble for a coffee filter, no need to measure out grounds-to-water ratio, and no need to concern yourself with heavy clean-up. You would also (2) be sacrificing the practicality of maintaining a set of different flavored coffees. If you want the different flavors of the old-fashioned method, you have to purchase several large bags of different flavors, which can lose their freshness over a short period of time. K-cups are individually packaged coffee grounds and can be purchased as an assortment of different flavors, from which you can choose to pop right into your machine and brew within seconds. The bottom line is, there is a lot of value into owning a Keurig machine, and the K155 will not disappoint. It has a large reservoir for water, which will brew around 10 cups of coffee per fill up. I haven't found refilling to be inconvenient at all. I no longer get that 'Jeez, I just filled this thing up a few hours ago' feeling I got from lesser-expensive Keurig models. It's solid, by comparison to lesser-expensive models as well. When you add a K-cup and close the latch, you get a nice reassuring, secure and sturdy clamp-down, no longer feeling like you may break the machine. Water heats in approximately 60 seconds and can remain heated while the machine is on. Great for that quick cup of Joe on the run. The touchscreen is gorgeous. This is something that will impress you and your guests as it is very eye-catchy and responsive. A light touch is all that is needed to select your volume of brew, then simply press the large (and arguably the most satisfying) button below the screen labelled 'BREW' and prepare for zen in a cup. The temperature of the water is heated PERFECTLY, the way a cup of coffee was intended. Hot, but not singe-your-taste-buds-from-your-tongue hot. Pleasantly heated with a Starbucks-level of care. This model can be installed onto your water line, which will auto-fill the machine with filtered water throughout its use. You must, however, purchase the optional $180 plumb kit for this convenience. As aforementioned, the included reservoir has not proven to be a nuisance to refill in my home thus far. Although, If I were purchasing this for my small business, I might consider investing in the plumb kit. My biggest gripe with this thing is that it is so beautiful in my kitchen, I can't resist the urge to want to brew a cup of coffee! I'm attracted to my Keurig K155 like a fly is to light. I'm certain my coffee consumption has increased since I bought this machine! Why only 4 stars you ask? Well 5 stars would indicate perfection. This falls just shy of perfection as it does NOT guarantee me a great deal of time with it (10 or more years full replacement warranty would get it a perfect score). My true score for it would be 4.5 if I could, but that task is for Amazon to improve.","My TRUE rating out of 10, is a solid 9. (Two-week review)",Amazon,88

So we're still in the honeymoon stage with this brewer at just under a week but, I find it to be much a better made product than the previous Keurig we had and it also seems to brew a little quicker too.  I thought I'd address a key point that some others had complained about: [TASTE] Whenever I buy a product that use for drinking, eating, etc., I always wash it first, I'm sure nearly everyone does that.  After reading that some people had a bad plastic taste in their coffee and couldn't get rid of it, I went into this with my eyes open. Upon opening it and washing it the first time, I too smelled a strong plastic smell and having some experience with sanitation methods, these are the steps I took to eliminate this taste issue.  Be prepared, it takes some time but in the end its worth it. Step 1:  Fill the reservoir full of hot water leaving room to add about 3 cups of 'other' liquids Step 2:  Finish filling the reservoir by adding 1/2 cup of regular bleach, [unscented!] and 2-1/2 cups of distilled white vinegar. Step 3:  Let soak until water cools off Step 4:  Wash the reservoir with dish soap, I prefer to use the regular Dawn soap but I suppose any will do. Step 5:  Fill the reservoir 3/4 way with filtered or bottled water and add 2 cups of distilled white vinegar. Step 6:  Without putting a pod into the brewer, run just the vinegar water through the system until it signals you the reservoir is empty. Step 7:  Begin filling the reservoir with more filtered or bottled water and repeat step 6. Step 8:  Repeat steps 6 & 7 above until you can no longer smell the vinegar in the hot water in the cup. By this time, you should have a cup of hot water that has no vinegar smell and absolutely no plastic smell. I discovered that it took about 20-25 cups to process mine, I wasn't actually counting but figured based on how much water I poured through it. Now I'm looking forward to great coffee - as is always the first step to any good cup of coffee, the water, be sure to use filtered or bottled water as straight tap water has a lot of calcium and other things that can make coffee taste bad.

We brew about 10 cups per day in our house.  This unit is clearly made for heavier usage than consumer models.  It also has several advantages over them that were not readily apparent until we started using it. First:  The K155 stays much cleaner.  In our consumer unit, there would always be stray coffee grounds strewn all over the inside that came out when the top foil was punctured.  This condition required a very thorough cleaning every week.  The K155 does not suffer from this condition.  In 5 months of continuous use, I have yet to see stray grounds inside the unit.  BIG PLUS.  Only the holder needs to be cleaned regularly. I purchased a second one so that we can swap them out while the dirty one is soaking. (Soak in Oxi Clean for an hour and run through the dishwasher.) Second:  It holds more water.  We use only distilled water.  The coffee maker lasts longer and doesn't require descaling at all.  It also means we are filling up pitchers of water from the cooler to fill the coffee maker quite often.  The K155 holds about 25% more water so there are fewer refill trips. It hasn't had a problem.  It works as well today as it did when we got it. We are very pleased.",I purchased a second one so that we can swap them out while the dirty one is soaking,Amazon,28

In fact, we own 3 Keurig brewers and 1 made by another brand between our home, offices, my workshop and our camper.  With the purchase of our new home, I wanted to upgrade from the routine of constant reservoir filling and bought the K155, direct plumb kit, and the filter system - all from Amazon.  Unfortunately, it was a rough experience overall and why I won't go above 3 stars after the problems.  First, my direct plumb kit came perfectly wrapped but the reservoir had a huge shatter crack in it!  No problem, Amazon made that right.  Then the K155...  I opened it and found the painted finish to be defective from the factory with discoloration behind where the cup sits and wrinkling/peeling along the edges of the 'jaw' for the K-cup holder.  I thought to myself it would probably look this way in a short time regardless because of how often it would be used so I cleaned and sanitized per the instructions.  After that I subsequently brewed the most unpalatable cup of 'plastic' ever!  Even just hot water through it wreaked of plastic!  I went through an exercise of multiple vinegar soaks and flushes (2 gallons, yes gallons of white vinegar) and the plastic taste and smell persisted to the point our entire kitchen smelled of it and it permeated into other rooms!  I looked for troubleshooting online and tired 2-3 more remedies but none worked.  So, I contacted Amazon who contacted the Amazon seller, and the seller wanted to ignore the requests from Amazon customer service.  I escalated the matter with Amazon who ultimately got on the seller, but I couldn't wait for that given the $$$ invested in this so I contacted Keurig directly.  Let me tell you what, I got a live person immediately after dialing and within 10 minutes had a brand new replacement K155 ordered for me!  I received it just just 2 business days later!  All I did for the replacement unit was wash everything per the cleaning/sanitation instructions and it brewed a perfect cup of Sumatra!

The horrible taste is somewhat diminished,  but still there. I am now having to go to the store every morning to get my cup of coffee.  This unit bespeaks of quality,  but it is all show and no go.

I went through the vinegar thing, and the baking soda thing, none of that stuff works.  That's for clearing out the inside of the machine from water rock, etc. Ultimately, I believe I found the problem and therefore the solution.  The plastic is going through a process called offgassing.  When plastic is formed it cures but is still changing for a period of time.  In this case, it was packaged and sealed well before this process occurred/completed.  Think about how a room smells like paint for a month after painting, even though the paint dried in a matter of hours.  Or how unpackaging a mattress is a very smelly event that lasts at least a week.  This is the same situation. So what IS the solution?  Wait.  Just remove and empty the tank, and wait.  Two weeks, four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, whatever it takes.  You can speed it up with increased airflow and even heat, so leave it with a fan blowing into the tank for a few days.  Some also believe the sun accelerates offgassing in plastic.  I pointed a hair dryer directly in mine and left it for an hour (maybe I should have done more, maybe less).  Maybe it would work to put it through the dishwasher (for the heat) but it really needs heat and air, not heat and water.  I didn't try the dishwasher. After allowing the offgassing, it works fine with no smell, but I still pull the tank off and let it dry and breathe every once in a while.  If you don't have a spare few months to wait, you may want to look for a different product. Per the support rep, they are well aware of this problem, but are still selling the products and then telling people to use vinegar and what-not.  The vinegar didn't change any of the smell.  What a waste of time.  It is no wonder they can't figure out how to manufacture it correctly.  All in all, it is completely irresponsible and unacceptable to be selling a food-grade product with this issue.  I was taken aback that they verified I had a water filter, but neglected to offgas the tanks (and other unknown parts?) before shipping.

WE PURCHAED DIRECTLY FROM KEURIG***I hate this coffee maker. Do not make the mistake of purchasing this model. We have had Keurig coffee makers for YEARS. We had accumulated enough points to purchase this one at a lower price through the Keurig Rewards program. I wouldn't want one if it were given to me for FREE (and the replacement was). It stunk to high heaven when we first received it. I went through the process of cleaning it the way Keurig described (vinegar cycle). Still stunk. I then poured just vinegar into the machine and let it sit for a day. Put about a gallon of water through it to clear out the vinegar. It STILL stunk. And by that I mean THE ENTIRE KITCHEN. We would wake up in the morning and that plastic smell would be the first thing we smelled. So, I ask you, if Keurig thinks they have the 'magic solution' to the plastic stench, why don't THEY run the brewers through whatever 'easy' process they think clears it up?? Why are they selling FOR OVER $200, a machine that they know STINKS. I called customer service, they asked if I had done the simple 'fix'. I said of course I did. Then they wanted me to send to them the k-cup basket from the machine AND PAY FOR SHIPPING as proof of ownership before they could send out a water resevoir to see if that was the cause. That is when I became irrate. Your 'proof of ownership' is the credit card you charged when I bought the piece of junk and the UPS tracking that you show on your computer that came right to my house! He relented and they sent AN ENTIRELY NEW MACHINE.  ????  Not sure what the hell happened on that call, but anyway, I got the new machine AND IT STINKS TOO. It also will not brew an entire cup (10 oz) of coffee.  It stops at about 4-6 ounces. I'm disgusted with the whole process. This is ridiculous.

Unbelievable that Keurig would release a product with such a terrible flaw.  The plastic used for the tank is a soft plastic, this may be why it degasses so strongly.  The degassing keeps going and going, making every cup taste gross.  It is not subtle, you cannot ignore it.  Some very lucky customers seem to not have this experience.  The only explanation I can think of is that the product they got was manufactured and then sat on a shelf in some warehouse long enough to fully degas before it was purchased. But there is good news.  It can be fixed. First I tried washing and soaking with vinegar.  This did not work at all.  Then I tried soaking in diluted isopropyl alcohol.  This seemed to work for about an hour, then the taste and smell came back as strong as ever. Finally, the solution: I went to the pet store and bought a gallon of activated carbon (charcoal).  This is used in fish tank filters.  I filled the Keureg tank with the dry carbon and put it outside in the mild warm weather, then let it sit there for 36 hours.  Then removed the charcoal and washed, wiped, washed again thoroughly.  Don't throw the charcoal away, it can be reused many times and it is not so cheap.  The smell was mostly gone.  Perhaps there was still a faint remanent.  More to the point, the coffee tasted great even 12 hours later.  Before bed, I repeated the process but this time for 12 hours and washed and used the next day.  I may repeat this a few more times just to be safe but the issue is resolved at the moment.  I did have to spend $25 on activated carbon which I should not have to do but, in the end worth it to get value out of the first $200 I spent on this thing.  Note that I did not try, but possibly baking soda instead of activated charcoal might have worked too and would probably have been cheaper.

Nice looking brewer but it always felt 'toyish' and only lasted 1.5 years. It gave out while I was descaling it I guess due to a weak water pump designed for home use. So I moved on to this commercial brewer I picked up at Staples and never looked back. I've had this K150/155 at home for about 4 years now and it hasn't missed a beat. The brewer itself feels solid and heavy like it's made with quality parts made to last and take commercial abuse. The beauty of this brewer is that it could be direct plumbed (after buying the kit) so an empty water tank is one less irritant before the first morning cup. That is ALWAYS a good thing. I have the brewer plumbed with an on-demand water pump that pumps Zephyhills Water up to the brewer (and fridge ice maker). The 5 gallon jugs sit in a cabinet under the brewer hidden away and once a week, I just switch empty for full jugs and keep on brewing. The only cons I've noted about this brewer is that it's louder and more expensive than the home brewers. But the pros far outweigh the cons. Adjustable water temperatures, different cup sizes, a wake on timer, a shut off timer, nice touchscreen and above all else, a really, really hot cup of coffee. Home brewers to me never really delivered water hot enough to make a nice cup of coffee. This monster does though. We exclusively use Coffee People Jet Fuel K-cups which in my old B70 tasted ok but the cup was never really hot enough. In this commercial brewer, the water is hot enough to brew coffee with a little crema on top. Seeing crema on coffee (to me) means a well brewed cup. Not barrista style but close enough (and cheap enough) where you can look forward to a good tasting strong cup of coffee, in your pajamas and a 'stay away from me until after the first cup' attitude. That alone makes this brewer a gem in this household.",Great Commercial for Home Use,Amazon,150

I've had it for a couple of monthss now, and it's awesome. The reservoir had a really strong plastic smell and taste, but that was starting to dissipate after about a week. It was pretty nasty, so I was refilling the reservoir before making each cup to keep the water fresh. This was pretty annoying, and seems to be a common issue among reviewers.  If I had stuck with the manual fill reservoir, I'd have gotten a replacement reservoir from Keurig.  Apparently they're very responsive to the plastic taste problem that exists with certain production runs of the brewer. I've upgraded the coffee maker with the B150 Direct Water Line Plumb Kit, and connected it to my existing Reverse Osmosis water line that goes to the refrigerator. No more plastic taste/smell, and no more refilling the reservoir! Woohoo! The Keurig My K-cup doesn't work with this model.

Maybe averaging 3-6 cups of coffee made every day, M-F. I literally never use it. I just ordered our third one of these. Bought the first in Feb of 2011. By April, it had already crapped out. Heater died, would no longer brew. Keurig sent us a new one. That one lasted until just a week ago. Brew pump pretty much failed and would not give enough pressure to brew when a k-cup was in. I'm guessing we ran around 3,000 - 4,000 k-cups through it (I'm probably high), but it seems like these things should be more reliable. We always use bottled water, and clean it on a regular basis. This is actually our 7th Keurig brewer in 6 years. The first were lower-end brewers, but they died within a few months or a year. Keurig replaced a few of them. I was not surprised when our first K155 died after only 2 months of use. Hoping this third one lasts a lot longer than the rest. It really is the best bang-for-your-buck k-cup brewer for a small office, plus it supports a dedicated water line with an accessory tank replacement. Straight up, Keurig brewers just aren't very reliable. I bought one for home a few years ago, it died within a few months. Only made like a dozen cups of coffee. Keurig replaced it, that lasted a few more months. Keurig replaced it, and that one worked great for like a year, then got to the point where it would never start brewing until I literally smacked the very top of the unit, and INSTANTLY it would start brewing.

Heats up in less than 10 seconds, and just works... always. Problem is, Starbucks has absolutely no variety of coffee/espresso, and nobody else will make Verismo pods. It's very limited, but they have my favorite bean in the world, Antigua Guatemala, in espresso and coffee pods. The rest of their coffees suck.

However, it lacks basic features.  it is NOT programable in anyway - no turn on time, no automatic shut off, no temp control.  It does NOT do travel mug size (12 oz).  It does NOT remember last cup size.  Very expensive just to have a 90oz water reservoir...

Upon reading reviews, some people have been complaining about a certain odor. My machine had an odor, but went away after the first rinse. I'm guessing there are certain ones that have stronger odors than others. I bought this machine after having the Kuerig 2.0 and I love this one a lot more. With the 2.0 you can ONLY use Kuerig brand K-Cups, but with this one you can use any brand of K-Cups. I'm happy!",Love it!,Amazon,1

It offers simplicity of operation for the volunteers that staff the shop. In particular, the ability to program it so that no one must remember to turn it on or off, or to set the size of serving (we use 10 oz. as our standard). This means the volunteer only needs to check and fill the water reservoir and clean the tray each day.  Periodically, the entire unit is thoroughly cleaned and inspected.

The limited options for brew sizes (4,6,8,10) is annoying, I miss the 12 ounce pour and really wish I could change the default pour (8oz).  The machine is huge, but fits perfectly on the counter top under a cabinet and the huge water reservoir means I only have to fill it once a day.

It also works with the refillable K cup filters I already own. So I can still use my own coffee and save the included K cups for mornings I am running late and don't have time to mess around.

And it still tasted and reaked of plastic.  I then tasted water that I poured out of the reservoir and it tasted like and smelled like plastic.  I gave up and sent it back.

1274,Keurig,"January 29, 2014","Keurig K155 Office Pro Coffee Maker Brewer, One Size, Silver",B00DWKEHU4,3,"I just purchased this, to replace a Cuisinart K-Cup machine that died.  The Cuisinart was the second one like it to die, and I had a Keurig die before that; the pumps go bad after a year or two.  I think that's common to many of the K-Cup brewers.  They have an absurdly short lifespan.  I sprung for this fairly expensive one in the hopes that it will last longer than the others.  We have one of these at my office, as well.  I don't use it a lot there (go across street for coffee), but it seems solid.  So I ordered one for home. I'm writing this review now to register an immediate disappointment: although the machine comes with four brew sizes, you cannot change the default size, which is 8 oz.  I always brew a 10 oz cup.  So now, I have to manually tell it, every time, to brew a 10 oz rather than another size.  You can 'delete' sizes.  I tried to delete everything except 10 oz, but it would only let me delete two of the four.  Which accomplished nothing, you still have to manually set it if you want anything other than 8 oz.  This is just a ridiculous design flaw; even my cheaper models from other brands allowed you to change the default. Just something to be aware of.  I'm giving it only three stars because I want to strongly express my disappointment at this with such an expensive brewer. Edit: One year later, I am still using this brewer (and still find the above annoying).  But I wanted to add one more fault that has developed.  The 'Brew' button has become increasingly cantankerous.  It takes more and more pressure to get it to work - about half the time now, I have to go back and push it a second, or even a third, time.  Also, the thing short-cups about 10% of the time now.",Disappointing: You can't change brew size default,Amazon,17

I tried rising and flushing and more rinsing and more flushing, the smell is putrid and the coffee tastes nasty.  I called Keurig and they told me to go out and buy white vinegar and run it through at full strength. I don't see how a food service product could be shipped with such impurity.  I sure hope that nasty stuff from the factory in China doesn't cause cancer. Update, At 2 months the smell persisted, I called Keurig's excellent customer service and they replaced it with a unit that doesn't smell,  now I can  enjoy it without reservation.  I am glad they stand behind the product, and I would say it is a fine machine, robustly constructed, quiet  and fun to use with the beautiful touch screen.  I wish it were designed to not require preheating, the way the Tassimo works, but otherwise is the excellent machine that I expected when I ordered it.

As long as you have room on your counter for it, I can't recommend it enough. The color LCD is pretty cheesy, it's only displaying what look like stock images of coffee beans, plants and the occasional diagram showing a k-cup being used. It's pretty pointless, but I'm not going to really complain about that.",Great home/office coffee maker,Amazon,31

This unit is a bit on the higher end price wise but in my opinion it is worth every penny.",I highly recommend this unit.,Amazon,14
