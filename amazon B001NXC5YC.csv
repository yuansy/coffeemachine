0,Hamilton Beach,"January 23, 2019","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,4,"Love the functionality of this coffee maker.  Fits on counter under my cabinets.  I have it near my sink, and I can just swivel it to the side, flip open the water compartment lid, and fill with water using my sink hose.  The coffee basket opens to allow front access, so I don't have to spoon coffee grounds over the top of the maker, which prevents a problem I've had w/other coffee makers....  spilling grounds where they shouldn't be, like into the machine or carafe.  There aren't many buttons to fool with, which I like because I don't use them anyway.  The carafe opens all the way for easy cleaning and could go into the dishwasher if I want.  If I were looking for a negative, I'd say that the carafe is very thin glass, so if you give it a decent bang against something it could break.  But I really love the coffee pot, and other than a potentially fragile carafe, I'd highly recommend it.",All the features I want but carafe could be the weakest link,Amazon,0

5,Hamilton Beach,"January 20, 2019","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,5,"I was looking for a very low cost, simple unit for daily use, but my one minimum requirement was for pre-set, automatic brewing time so coffee would be ready when I stumbled into the kitchen half asleep in the morning. MANY products to choose from, but the price on this unit was appealing and I was attracted to its swivel base and detachable water container for easy filling at a faucet (rather than having to fill the carafe and pour that into a fixed tank). I was concerned by reviews that cited brewing coffee overflowing the coffee basket with larger brew sizes, but since I typically only brew six cups, I thought I would not encounter that problem and bought it. Honestly, I have to rate this as a 5, far exceeding my (admittedly minimal) expectations. It is easy to set up and has worked perfectly for the several months we have used it. Although my largest brew size to date has only been ten cups, you can see from my attached picture that with fine-to-medium ground coffee beans, the brewing coffee level was well below the top of the paper basket. (Maybe other reviewers used super ground coffee or packed it into the basket? Anyway, I am pretty confident I will succeed with 12 cups using my grinder setting.) Note: Since my wife and I HATE stale coffee, I would prefer that this Hamilton Beach unit have burner on/off choice rather than three temperature selections. But we still think the product deserves an overall 5 rating.  (We previously used thermal carafe units to keep coffee warm without getting stale from long-term burner cooking (the last from Melitta - reviewed negatively on this site because the flawed carafe leaks all over when pouring and their customer support is poor).","Simple, very usable design at a very low price",Amazon,0
6,Hamilton Beach,"January 19, 2019","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,5,"This is the second one of these that I have bought, and I loved them both.  The biggest advantage:  The plastic carafe that sits on the back of the machine is so much easier to fill and set onto the machine than the typical glass carafe that has to be filled and then poured into the top of the coffeemaker.  This machine also has an easy-to-program timer (so you can wake up to the smell of coffee in the morning!), 1-4 cup setting, and, my favorite: a bold setting.  I also like that it doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space on the counter, and, frankly, it looks like a much more expensive coffeemaker than it is.",So easy to fill; programmable; looks more expensive than it is,Amazon,0

8,Hamilton Beach,"January 18, 2019","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,3,"Loved the removable water reservoir, coffee grounds basket and controls/display. But after about 1 1/2  years of use, the coffee strength button has become stuck on the 'Bold' setting, and water leaks out from the very bottom of unit onto the kitchen counter frequently. The problem would seem to be fixed for a time when coffee maker was cleaned using a 3 to 1 white vinegar to water ratio, but after only 4-5 days later, the leaking water problem would come back. Not sure why this is such a problem. We do have water with a very high salt content, but I only use filtered water from my refrigerator water dispenser with which to brew coffee, which I think should nullify salt as the cause of the problem, as we've never noticed any visible build up of dissolved solids inside the reservoir or any where else on the coffee maker. Wish I could give it more stars, as I like the overall design and coffee taste.",WATER LEAKAGE PROBLEM,Amazon,0

I liked that the water reservoir was removable and we could take that to the sink to fill it instead of filling the carafe and having that water drip out while being poured in...But then it suddenly stopped working.  It would brew, and not all of the water would go through, so about half the water was still left in the back reservoir after it stopped brewing.  UGH!

We are now on our 3rd, 1 in a summer house and 1 in our 'permanent' house.  It's easy to use, easy to clean and makes good coffee.  We've had one problem I'd love help with:  at some point in its age it begins to make a lot of steam and more brewing noise and ultimately produces less liquid coffee - the water has gone into steam.  I've read an online article about grounds backing up into the area the water flows through but I don't know how that happens or how to flush any such problem.  Has anyone else experienced this?

27,Hamilton Beach,"January 8, 2019","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,5,"I purchased this primarily on recommendation from the Wirecutter, and it lived up to the expectation. The best feature -- and the reason I purchased it -- is the programmable start. You can put the grounds and water in at night, set it to start, and then wake up to the smell of fresh coffee brewing without the need to stumble around in the dark and cold kitchen pre-caffeination. One note on design/cleaning: The carafe has a slight lip causing it to retain some liquid in the bottom when you pour it out. This isn't really an issue as no one really wants the last dregs of coffee anyway, but if you tend to rinse it right before using it,  your coffee may get ever so slightly diluted with the remaining water. The electrical cord has a winding compartment under the unit, which makes it easier to store, and its roughly rectangular shape and rotating base make it easy to fit underneath a cabinet.",Simple and Effective,Amazon,0

37,Hamilton Beach,"January 4, 2019","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,5,I think this machine makes a good pot of coffee using a standard medium grind for drip coffee makers. I would avoid finer grinds (typical of pre-ground European coffees) in this machine. I measured the water temperature directly beneath the shower head at 195.6 degrees Fahrenheit. I'd say that's pretty remarkable (hot) for the price tag. No wonder The Wirecutter found this produced a better tasting brew than the OXO Barista Brain in one of their tests. Build quality appears on the cheap side but I think it'll be fine if treated with reasonable care. The carafe seems to be of good quality.

45,Hamilton Beach,"December 31, 2018","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,5,"I've only had this coffee maker for a few days, so I can't speak to its durability. But I love its features! I've had cheap drip coffee makers, and I've had expensive drip coffee makers. This is the only maker that re-thought how they should work. All of the other coffee makers require the carafe to be filled first by faucet, then the water poured into some slot in the coffee maker. This Hamilton Beach rethought all of this. They made the water tank removable, so I fill it once in the sink and drop it into the spot in the back of the coffee maker. And to make the back of the coffee maker more accessible, the bottom of the maker is on circular rollers, so it swivels easily. I make coffee every day, so convenience features like this MATTER. Why should I have to fill some carafe, and then fill the coffee maker, when really I wanted to put water in the coffee maker in the first place? The user interface is very intuitive. I've had some coffee makers that required me to read the manual to figure out how to use the delay feature. And another manufacturer emits an irritating beep when the coffee is finished, and it cannot be disabled. I get up long before my family, so that beep was a deal breaker. I don't think I've ever written a review for a product, but this one is making me so happy that I decided to do so. If the carafe breaks in a year, I'll buy another one. Who cares if I can't buy a replacement carafe? They're always almost as expensive as the coffee maker anyway. It's a $30 coffee maker--same price as all the competitors--that makes the same quality of coffee that the others do, but with more convenient and intuitive features.

126,Hamilton Beach,"November 4, 2018","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,5,"Finally an electric drip coffee maker that is designed to make it easy to clean. The best feature is the removable water reservoir that is wide enough that you can actually fit your hand inside to clean it!  If you don't want to carry the reservoir to the sink, this coffee maker also has little wheels on the bottom so that you can easily rotate the machine to open the water reservoir for filling from a pitcher. The adjustable temperature on the warming plate is a nice feature, as is the small footprint. All of the controls/settings are very basic and easy to use.  Saw some negative feedback about steam getting into the clock due to a gap in the machine's construction under the clock. Mine doesn't have that gap which leads me to believe theirs was actually damaged in transit. There is, however, a small vent at the top of the machine to allow the steam to escape.

I am not a person who breaks things regularly or doesn‚Äôt take care of my things, so this was a first for me. I bumped it on the corner of my metal kitchen sink & that broke the glass & put a hole in the bottom edge of the carafe/pot. I was shocked. I‚Äôve done that a few times before (while rinsing out the previous days coffee) with my old Black & Decker model & never once broke the pot in 3 years. I‚Äôm convinced their carafe is faulty bc of this... however, I love the coffee maker machine itself, so I ordered a replacement carafe. It arrived within about 2 weeks, but cost a fortune ($17 for the pot + $15 shipping, Ground! = $34) compared to the price of buying an entirely new unit ($36 at this time). Not thrilled about that. Hamilton Beach‚Äôs customer service email/support sucks too, so if you email them with any questions be prepared to wait. They say they‚Äôll reply within 15 days or something like that, which is useless in most cases & their phone support isn‚Äôt within my available hours. My product arrived before they‚Äôve responded to my email. Overall, I still love my coffee maker, but the pot itself is definitely faulty. Expect to replace it at least once in the lifetime you use this model. I don‚Äôt regret purchasing it originally, but I am irritated about the faulty pot. Not sure if I would purchase this model again bc of that issue. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The pause & pour feature works like a charm & is honestly one of the main reasons I bought this model. When we have guests over, it's so nice not to have to wait for the 2nd pot of coffee before we can continue drinking; and it's nice for me on weekends when I don't use the auto brew feature since I'm ready to make coffee at differing times than during the week. The water container on the back is super easy to access since the bottom has little wheels on it, which help it twist around effortlessly; great for people who keep the coffee maker under low cabinets, like me. It's easy to fill & put back; love that I don't have to fill up the pot & pour the water in from there. The buttons are easy to use & feel more sturdy than I'm used to, and the display is clear. The swing out tray for the coffee grounds is a nice feature also. My one pet peeve, is the way the pot is designed. It is as they say; very hard to spill when pouring from it & that IS nice. However, it does make it hard to get the last drops out of the pot, and also hard to rinse it out, whether rinsing out soap when hand-washing or rinsing out old coffee before making a new pot. Not the end of the world, but I wish they'd have thought about that somehow when designing it. Again: it's nice that spills are less likely, BUT it does make it harder to get the last little bit of liquid out. Not a huge deal; it doesn't make me wish I hadn't purchased this model, but it is a design flaw worth mentioning. (It's worth noting that I haven't had this coffee maker for more than 1 or 2 weeks, and haven't used the adjustable brew strength features yet, or the adjustable 'keep warm' temperature settings.)",LOVE it!

The pot doesn't seem to fit in the warmer very well; it's very tight, and I feel like it doesn't make good contact with the warming plate unless I push it down, and I worry about putting pressure on the glass pot so it fits flatter in the ceramic heater.

196,Hamilton Beach,"September 28, 2018","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,2,"I was in the market for a new coffee maker, and was annoyed with the old one that didn't pour evenly and didn't have a very big reservoir opening. This one came reviewed highly, with a reasonable price tag and a great feature that let me fill the reservoir AT THE SINK. So I pulled the trigger and bought it. DO NOT DO THIS. First and immediate problem: The filter basket is not big enough for a standard filter. Even after carefully fitting it in and holding it open while I cautiously added grounds, the filter ran the risk of overflowing while it was brewing and getting grounds in my pot anyway. This was partly mitigated by buying a wire filter to hold the paper one, but you still have to be more careful than is always possible before you drink coffee in the first place. Second problem: The pot STILL doesn't pour cleanly into a cup. The way the lid and the rim of the pot are constructed, you get a certain amount of liquid curving back along the pot if you don't tip it exactly right. So I was still cleaning up coffee spills, plus when anybody else made coffee at my house and didn't use the removable reservoir, I ended up mopping spilled water too. Third and worst problem: It lasted less than a year. One day the heating element just decided that it didn't have to work anymore. I replaced it with a $20 Mr Coffee that fits the filter and pours cleanly, which negates the need to carry a water reservoir to the sink in the first place. The coffee itself was fine (after you strained out the excess grounds). I appreciated the removable reservoir and the ability to set the holding temperature. It just isn't worth the mess, or the short amount of time it actually worked.",Messy and fragile,Amazon,0

MUST have a removal water tub. Makes life SO much easier to get water from the sink instead of pouring from the coffee pot into the water tub. The bonus (that may not matter to you but it did me) is that the lid is attached!!! Not another piece! 2. The swivel feet! I never knew I needed a coffee pot with rollers on the bottom until I got this one! Whoever thought of that idea that works at Hamilton Beach, they need a raise! 3. The part that the grounds go into is very easy to manipulate by a push of a button! 4. The glass design is SO nice! I got a stainless steal one that was my last one. I didn't see a need for another stainless steel because we drink the pot so fast. I forgot how nice it is to have glass and you can SEE your delicious coffee (or if any grounds made it in!) 5. It does not take up a lot of space! I am trying to keep minimal items on my counters to keep them looking less cluttered. Having this compact machine is PERFECT.

They still sell this model, but do not offer a carafe as an accessory. So my ONLY choice if I still wanted the same features was to order the entire machine. Shame on Hamilton Beach for not making these available. I looked at other HB carafes before taking this step, and the reviews were mixed about whether they would fit my machine. Some said 'no' some said 'Yes' but it was a very tight fit and you had to force it into place. When you plugged the model number in to check whether it was compatible, the answer was 'not sure'.

Pros: - Detachable water reservoir makes filling up with water fast and easy. - Swing out filter basket is simple to use  and eliminates coffee parts hanging about - Pitcher pours fast without spills - Has nice options and a handy, dandy clock - Does not produce a lot of steam from top valve Cons - Does not brew hot coffee. - Warming plate actually heats/cooks coffee up to temperature - Rotation feature is lame, but machine is light weight and easy to move The design is attractive and makes the machine narrow but deep. I felt as if I lost more counter space than with the width but shallower",After one year,Amazon,0
381,Hamilton Beach,"May 4, 2018","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,3,"This coffee maker has good points and one, fatal flaw..  I've used it for a few weeks now and here's what I've found. On the PLUS side: 1. It has a smaller footprint than other coffee makers and fits nicely under the cupboards.  I like the angular, square shape instead of the cumbersome round shape. 2. The coffee maker looks reasonably high-end.  The amount of black plastic takes it down a notch but the steel look at the top adds some sleekness.  After all, this comes in under $50.00 so I wasn't expecting a full-on Euro-luxe look. 3. It's SIMPLE & EASY to set up!  You shan't need to consult the instruction book - it's that simple and obvious.  A big plus. 4. This coffee maker has some incredibly useful, attractive features:  a swivel base;  an EASY-TO-FILL WATER RESERVOIR; a pull-out coffee-ground dispenser.  I bought the permanent gold filter and find that it works well. 5. All the component parts are top-shelf dishwasher safe. Why then, the Three-Star Rating?? Here's the ONE Minus that, to me, negates all the above: The 46205 Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker DOES NOT make the coffee hot enough. Forget about 'enough' - it wasn't HOT.  My trusty kettle boils hotter water than this. Not even when it's fresh.  After 2 hours holding time, I found the coffee to be tepid. Very disappointing.  I bought this for visitors to my house and found them sneaking their mugs into the microwave to get the coffee hot enough. Coffee should be steaming, piping hot on first pour.  That's how I like it, although I'm far from being an avowed coffee devotee. I'll be keeping this machine as I'm too indolent to pack it all up and return it.  Don't have the time, really. If you're looking for a feature-packed coffee maker that looks rather nice on your kitchen counter, you can't go much wrong with this machine.  The price is excellent for what you get. Just don't expect really hot coffee...

We only used filtered water to avoid scale buildup which could disrupt the reservoir seal. Everything seemed to work normally until about 13 months in the controls just stopped coming on. no light, no control response at all. No mechanical or other electrical issues. Turned out the zener diode based voltage regulator for the controls just quit, powering the display from an independent supply caused it to work fine. Come on man. We've got phone watches, robot rockets launching electric super cars into space for FUN, and televisions so HD your eye can't discern the pixels, and ol Hamilton Beach here can't get a couple radio shack style diodes and resistors into some kind of reliable configuration? Do passing grades in high school electronics qualify you for electronics design at HB? In summary: IF you get lucky and the face plate doesn't fall off, decanter doesn't asplode, reservoir doesn't leak, and the plastic door thingy stays in place, you can STILL count on the extremely simple -and in no way technologically challenging to manufacture in the 21st century- voltage regulator to let you down.

399,Hamilton Beach,"April 18, 2018","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,4,"I'd give 4.5 stars if I could. This is the best maker I've ever bought. Making coffee is extremely simple because of the rear lift out water holder. It fits in my sink right under the faucet and while it's filling it I am able to weigh out 94 grams of beans and get the burr grinder going.As that is happening I get the carafe rinsed out and a filter installed, grinding completed/transferred to the filter compartment, (tapped and shook to level the grinds), and on button pushed. All done quickly and often while I am still half asleep. So why am I not giving 5 stars? As ergonomically excellent as this machine is there are 3 caveats that need to be kept in mind when using it. No.1: the filter door needs a very firm push to click into locked position. If this is not done the coffee will overflow the filter and onto the counter, floor, everywhere. No.2: The clock reset button is right next to the on/off button on the front and it is not too difficult to accidentally hit that button and reset the clock. No 3: The store bought filters I had on hand were slightly smaller in height than the better ones I eventually purchased here on Amazon. If one has the slightly smaller filters the grinds will come very close to and possibly overflow the top. With the better (as in taller) filters the 94 grams of grinds I use fits perfectly and never overflows as long as I do the tapping trick before FIRMLY closing the filter door. So in sum, I really love this machine and it makes very good coffee, a larger amount than most cheap machines, and the temp of the coffee is perfect. Perhaps my three problems are due to early morning half asleep clumsiness, not a fault of the machine, so I advise potential purchasers to read other reviews and see if these are common problems or just my bad.

We had the older model of this coffee maker and it worked so great for years. When it died, we were excited to be able to replace it with, what we thought, was the same coffee maker. They've changed some things with this newer model and we are consistently having issues with it. Especially when trying to brew a smaller amount of coffee. It doesn't seem to fully process the coffee and we wind up with a very weak pot of coffee. We have to run the coffee through a second time. We thought we just got a bad one initially. Set up a replacement. The replacement is working worse than the previous one. This is just not the same coffee maker that we loved. The design is so great too.

The water reservoir and swing out basket are very nice features to make filling a lot easier.  Our coffee comes out tasting good and piping hot.  The people who have complained on here about the temperature either got a bad machine or are sadistic.  Our measures 185.2 degrees after an hour on the warming plate which is plenty hot.  Too hot to drink straight out of the pot.  Yes the machine is light and may feel a bit cheaply maid however this is that case with any machine under $100 (and some overt that amount).  It looks good and has a small footprint.  This replaced a Cuisinart and a Hamilton beach dual machine.  The Cuisinart from Costco was cheaply made and we had gone through a few of them over the years for various reasons.  The biggest problem I had with the Cuisinart was how it poured.  That you had to pour very slowly or else it leaked.  Very annoying and Hamilton Beach pots do not have this problem.  The Dual Machine from Hamilton beach either made a pot or had side for making a travel mug.  That worked well but was very large for our counter.  Additionally that had a known problem with the paint on the warming plate pealing off and rusting.  Ours experienced that and as a result I am drying the bottom of the pot on this machine before placing the pot back after cleaning.  I am not sure if this machine ahs the same warming plate but it is just easier to dry it and be cautious.,Great Coffee Maker,Amazon,3

This was while the coffee pot was set to 'bold' and had been cleaned on a regular basis.  We also couldn't brew a full 12 cups of coffee.  The basket wasn't deep enough to hold the 6 scoops of coffee during the brew cycle.

When you close the door, it pushes the far end of the paper filter over, down into the grinds as water comes out. If you buy this, get shorter 4-6 cup filters. You'll be sorry if you go with the 10-12 cup filters. I would have done that in the first place, but NOWHERE does it Hamilton Beach say what size or number filters should be used with this.

I settled on this Hamilton Beach after googling something like 'good cheap coffee maker' and finding a review that rated this the best among 17 inexpensive machines. I'm very happy with it. I generally make 4-6 cups (2-3 mugs) once or twice a day. The 1-4 cup setting seems to work best for me, although I've used the regular and bold settings and like them too. Brew time is about 10 minutes, which of course is slower than a Bunn, but the coffee tastes great and is nice and hot, and I'm not wasting electricity anymore. To speed things up I tried the pause and pour function. It works, but I thought the coffee wasn't quite hot enough, so now I just let it go the whole ten minutes and the coffee is better, perfectly hot.

692,Hamilton Beach,"November 14, 2017","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,3,"I purchased this item to replace my previous Cuisinart drip coffee maker that died after several years of daily brewing.  I also purchased the permanent drip basket because I don't like filters. In short: Coffee produced is very inconsistent in flavor and strength.  The first few days of use yielded delicious coffee.  The following week was watery and weak coffee.  The next week was good again.  This week I am having daily variations it seems. Routine: 1.  Lavazza Super Crema, whole bean.  Two different batches were tried. 2.  Coffee beans are scooped with a 1/8th cup measuring cup, because it fits nicely in my coffee container (and I have no other use for a 1/8 cup). 3.  Krups blade grinder. 4.  Water filled to the 6 'cup' mark. The above was the same technique used for my old drip machine, however I've had to increase the coffee amount from 2 to 2.5 heaps of coffee beans from the 1/8th cup measure to get the same effect on 'good' days.  I've also had to use the 'Bold' setting on this machine. I suspect this machine has a problem with the heater or heat sensing electronics.  My insta-read thermometer will sometimes register 193-195 degree coffee exiting the nozzle, and sometimes in the high 180s under the same settings.  Optimal temperature for coffee brewing is typically 195 to 205F.  I'll also note that I pour my coffee into a preheated travel mug and I feel the coffee from this machine does not remain hot quite as long into the morning as the coffee from my previous machine. Otherwise the design is pretty nice.  I like the removable reservoir.  The carafe is comfortable, although the last bit of coffee or cleaning liquid is impossible to pour out.  The swivel base is a nice idea, but the rollers should be bigger.  The plastic 'feet' on my machine poke down a bit too far and sort of drag along the counter during the swivel, which negates the whole effect. In conclusion, I would stay away from this machine.  Other reviews seems to report quality issues as well.  Of course several reviews are quite happy with this model.  Perhaps taste bug variation plays a roll, or perhaps I just received a lemon machine.  Regardless, I would return it except the box got pitched. <sadface> Update 12-7-17. Still inconsistent and mostly weak coffee.  It seems the water does not contact all the grounds (see image).  I hadnt noticed this phenomenon previously because my wife always empties the basket, until i did today.  Totally unwet grounds is pretty bad. Update 1-1-18: Machine continues to be infuriatingly inconsistent.  Coffee this morning was weak tea at best (see image).  This was using the 'bold' setting.  Coffee grounds were again partially dry post brew. Update 2-9-18: I have found that this machine with the basket filter is really sensitive to inconsistent grind size.  Blade grinders usually leave a few larger chunks, and these chunks float to the middle and become like drainage rock in the filter basket.  If i over grind to eliminate any large chunks, the coffee is much more consistent.  However, over grinding has other issues with taste.  In the end, this coffee maker is probably only good for use with pre-ground coffee, burr ground coffee, and/or paper filters. Update 3-16-2018 After switching to paper filters, inconsistency has been eliminated.  I do not recommend permanent basket 80675R/80675 with this coffee maker.  The basket base is concave up, which reduces the thickness of grounds under the spout.  The water-to-ground contact dynamic seems to suffer dramatically.

Plastic is marginal-don't even think about buying this without the extra warranty-only about $ 3.00 for  3 yrs-will never make it.

Won't fit correctly in the reservoir-water goes thru without going thru the filter-now in the trash.

So I ordered a replacement carafe on the Hamilton Beach web site from a CSR who assured me that their replacement was the correct item.  I could not find it on the HB web site myself.  The CSR said that it was there, and I probably could not find it, because there was no picture of the carafe.  (Their search box didn't bring it up either.)  When it finally came, I was so disappointed to discover that it really doesn't fit well at all.  I had to tip the carafe forward in order to squeeze it into place.  The domed top on the lid is a little too high to slip easily into place like the carafe that came with the coffee maker.  This could ba a safety issue especially when the carafe is filled up to its capacity, 12 cups.  I love the coffee maker, itself, and have two.

Special pot (carafe) that doesn't spill when you pour. 2.) Instead of filling the pot and then pouring it into the reservoir, the reservoir detaches and you bring that to the sink for easy fill up. That's great for me because I'm getting a little too shaky for pouring. 3.) Programmable. 4.) Excellent price point for features included. Time will tell if it's reliable and long lasting. I hope so. EDIT: After a month, the best coffee pot design I'd ever seen failed because of a manufacturing defect, which i suspect all of them share. Such a shame! There is an opening underneath the LCD display that allows steam to damage it- the clock is totally unreadable. Here's how I deal with the LCD failure and still get the automatic morning brew: Unplug the pot for 30 seconds. When you plug it back in it's at that default blinking 12am setting. (Not that you can see it, since the LCD is destroyed- but it is.) Press the hour button carefully- if it's 2pm, you'd press it 14 times; if 6am- you'd press it 6 times. For the programming time, press and hold the program button while you click the hour button again- press hour 6 times while holding in the program button for 6 am coffee. I feel the basic design is great but change that aspect so the clock won't get water damaged.",Things I like about this,Amazon,10

(Personally, I do like my coffee less hot so I can drink it). Cons: -None really. I was nervous when I bought this because the description makes a big deal about removing the back portion, twisting the thing around, and a slide out drawer to hold the coffee, and my counter is really tight.

755,Hamilton Beach,"October 19, 2017","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,1,"This was my second Hamilton Beach dud. The coffee maker is very nice-looking and made good coffee that stayed hot...for a few months. Then it suddenly started making totally weak, awful coffee. I contacted customer service and was told to run a cleaning cycle 'as instructed on page 11' of the manual. I did so, and it definitely helped. (I also always use filtered water.) BUT two weeks later, the coffee was suddenly back to bad (very weak). So I ran another cleaning cycle. Presto, the coffee was good again! BUT this morning, just one week after the second cleaning cycle, it was BAD AGAIN. I have had maybe a half-dozen other coffee makers by various manufacturers over the years, and none of them have had this issue. Actually, none of them had any issues until they got very old and were dying. I thought that perhaps I just had a lemon, so I called Hamilton Beach to find out about replacing it. I was unpleasantly surprised to hear that I‚Äôd have to pay for shipping the replacement (ridiculously expensive) and, since they no longer make this model, pay the difference between my model and a replacement model. So much for that warrantee. This made me remember an experience I‚Äôd totally forgotten about, involving a Hamilton Beach sandwich press I'd bought a few years ago. It worked fine for a few months, and then one day just was completely dead. At that time I‚Äôd also spoken to Hamilton Beach's customer service department and found out I‚Äôd have to pay a hefty shipping fee for a replacement ‚Äî totally not worth it for these relatively inexpensive appliances, especially given how shoddily they appear to be made. Hamilton Beach has the worst return/replacement policies of any company I‚Äôve ever dealt with. By far. I rarely review products online, preferring to let the company make things right when there‚Äôs a problem with its product, but Hamilton Beach has failed me now twice in this respect. I only hope I remember to avoid its products the next time I am shopping for an appliance. UPDATE: In response to my note to Hamilton Beach saying all of this as a follow-up to my initial complaints to the company, customer service sent me a note saying, 'Shipping and handling is not covered under the limited warranty, as stated in your use and care guide. However, as a customer courtesy, Hamilton Beach will cover partial shipping cost, reducing your total to $7.99.' HB told me I could go to its website and 'select another model of equal value ($39.99)' as a replacement; I paid the current Amazon price, $44.99, in June, and they list some for $39.99 and some for $49.99, with free shipping. Either way, I don't want to risk having to go through this again in a few months if/when the replacement conks out.",Works well...for a little while....,Amazon,5

Water splashed all over the place when filling and it seemed to be pretty cheaply made. So back it went and we ordered this on line.  Hamilton Beach doesn't have that issue at all. The removable reservoir makes cleaning super easy. The swivel base is very nice. It's not so loose as to allow the unit to slide around on the counter, but you can rotate it without having to strong arm it. I hope they keep manufacturing this model. I don't believe in messing with perfection, so will always buy this as my replacement when the new one wears out. Addendum. I've been using this coffee maker for a few days now. I'm still happy with it, but I'm also glad that I hadn't tossed out the old one yet. Hamilton Beach has decided to go with a dark gray reservoire, instead of the opaque white one of old. The new reservoire makes it hard to see the water level. It also doesn't seem to seat as well as the old old one. So, I tried the old one and it fit great. I will continue to use it. I just wish the design engineers would remember the old adage. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. If it works great, don't mess with it. The older model coffee maker that they produced was as good as it gets, and they shouldn't have changed anything about it!!! Please leave this one alone, except for going back to the original reservoire. I promise that I will always buy this one when my current one wears out. I will also but this for a gift for anyone I know who needs a new coffee maker. Just stop screwing with it.",Beautifully Engineered,Amazon,17

788,Hamilton Beach,"September 30, 2017","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,5,"I like this coffeemaker for the thoughtful design.  First, it's a basic model - it makes coffee, has a clock and a programmable timer to start brewing when you want, and it has a removable reservoir.  That reservoir is why I chose this model.  My old coffeemaker had a tube on the side to show the level of water in the reservoir.  The problem was that the tube was exposed to sunlight and it started to turn green (algae?) and it couldn't be cleaned, even with white vinegar.  Yuk!  This coffeemaker had a removable container for the water so it's easy to clean.  Everything works and it makes good coffee.  Even the programming is straightforward - you can probably figure it out without the manual.  The little wheels on the bottom make it easy to roll on the countertop to get to the reservoir. Two notes:  1.  I'm not so happy with the carafe - it has a plastic ring around the top rim that prevents you from draining it completely so you don't get that last gulp or so.  Even after rinsing with water and shaking it, water remains in the bottom. 2.  Make sure there's clearance above the coffeemaker when it's brewing.  There a vent at the top that allows steam to escape so it's best to not brew underneath cabinet tops.",Great basic coffeemaker,Amazon,8

It worked great for about 7 months, then the auto function quit working! I need my coffee ready and waiting when I wake up: especially since I use the 'Bold' brew feature, which takes a while (but worth it!). I loved how my coffee tasted, so hated to switch, but gave in and bought a Mr. Coffee from Costco for the automatic feature. Total waste: coffee tasted terrible - so back it went! I went back to the original - minus the auto-function - and used it a couple more months until the thing just died: the buttons quit working entirely... Now what?

It's poorly made with plastic- I was definitely expecting better quality from this company. 2- the 'cups' are only 5oz each! Who makes a 5 oz cup of coffee? I bought this pot because it brews 12 cups but really it doesn't. 3- be warned- when you fill the reservoir to 12 cups...it brews 10! Or when you fill to 10- you'll get 8! The water gets held up in the coffee filter. 4- the main reason I bought this one was for the easy access with the reservoir and it spins. Well once it's filled with water it's very difficult to spin. 5- the coffee tastes ok- not the best and I even tried different brands. Seems I need ALOT more coffee to get a strong cup even when set to brew bold.

There is also a really neat little compartment for storing excess cord.  I love that the basket swivels out instead of being fixed in place; my last coffee maker had a fixed basket, which was a big pain to clean if the coffee grinds overflowed.  There are also brewing options, a very cool idea to me.  I love a bold brew, but some people like weaker coffee, so it's nice to have some flexibility.  Lastly, my old coffee maker did not have the little steam vents like this one, which made for a wet mess when the cover over the coffee filter would get forced up by steam, streaking up my wall into artwork or pooling around the base of the unit.

944,Hamilton Beach,"August 7, 2017","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,5,"After almost two months of daily use we still love this product. I spent a ridiculous amout of time researching this purchase because it seems every coffeemaker has some fatal flaw or problem. We wanted a relatively inexpensive unit that wasn't a Mister Coffee, because we had to return each one we bought in recent years for various reasons. This model, or it's cousin, got a top review in Sweethome, recommended for people like us who prefer package flavored coffee like Dunkin Donuts brand to expensive high-end beans (in that case you might want a fancier coffeemaker). I considered several other HB models until I saw that this one has a removable water container. It's easy to fill and clean, and seems more sanitary than an internal one (I pried up the bottom of our last coffeemaker after it died and discovered dirty water with coffee grounds and who knows what in the water tube.) This has the other features we wanted: programmable with a readable clock, easy to use coffee basket, and a drip-proof, sturdy carafe. I also like that the electronics are on the top - that way, if you overfill the unit, or it leaks somehow, you don't get liquid on the sensitive parts (I think we killed at least one unit that way). It takes about 15 minutes to brew a full pot, with a little gurgling noise at the end (no audible alert), keeps it at the right temperature and shuts itself off in 2 hours. The heater is adjustable and we set in one level below the highest temperature because it works so well. The pause feature also works well - the basket doesn't drip when the pot is removed. There are settings for Bold and Small Cup which we don't use much but work fine. The only complaint we have is that the inside of the upper rim of the pot holds a bit of water when you turn it upside down, so you can't completely dry it that way. However, that design may be why it pours so easily. Also, you have to pour carefully when you have a full pot or you might spill a bit. These are minor issues so we kept the 5 rating. The price was great too, maybe $10 - $15 more than cheaper models but with so many more features.",Great everyday coffeemaker,Amazon,4

Problem was it did not get very hot. After putting in cream inside a pre-heated cup the temp was about 120 degrees. Not very hot luke warm. I returned it to Wal-mart. NOW; I wish I had just exchanged it for the same unit. That one may have had something wrong on heating it but it's better than what I have now. I like Hamilton-Beach, this is my third H-B over the past decade. However, this unit is the worst, that is, I liked the Black&Decker better than this for 3 reasons I've always liked performance and quality of the Hamilton-Beach appliances I owned  this is not representative of their company or up to their normal good quality standards.   Now for the reasons. 1. I never had coffee take so long to make. I can start it up, feed my 3 cats,  including washing their bowls and its still not done. I'll finish getting dressed and when I am done, head back into the kitchen and it's just finishing making 4 cups of coffee. Not a whole pot! reason 2. It's not my imagination but I have to use far more coffee, (twice the amount) to yield the same amount of fresh brew than what I've added in the past or at least with the Black & Decker. I am really going through the coffee. reason 3. The coffee does not taste as good as other coffee makers I had including the H-B that quit working for me a couple months ago. I am serious. The coffee does not have as good of a taste as it should. Even with adding double coffee grounds it tastes rather bland. Believe me a coffee maker is not all the same and 'you will get different tastes with different coffee machines'  I really love the way you pour the water into the container and it is easy to read and even have the option of lifting it out the water reservoir  and filling  it under the faucet.

You can also pick up the whole reservoir, right out of the machine, and fill it at the sink - very easy to do and to replace. There's also a button on the front that allows you to adjust the heat of the warmer.  We tend to sit for an hour or so over cups of coffee in the morning (right - we're retired!), and our last machine kept the coffee so hot it had that boiled taste before we hit the end of the pot.

We usually had to run hot water through the coffee maker a couple times but even then could still taste...something off. We're not sure why this coffee maker doesn't impart that taste. Maybe it's because of the separate reservoir that is easy to take off and fill without spilling water like we did when we had to fill a carafe and pour it in. So far we have been very happy with this purchase. My only complaint is I do wish it would beep when it's finished like our previous coffee maker did.",Satisfied with it,Amazon,5

976,Hamilton Beach,"July 23, 2017","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,3,"This coffee maker was delivered to us on July 5, 2017 so not an extensive amount of use yet. However, we usually make at least 2 pots a day and occasionally 3 so we do have some experience with it. We purchased this coffee maker to replace an ailing one from a different manufacturer and decided to chance this one based on reviews. My wife and I are both very pleased with our purchase. She prefers a different brand of coffee than what I like and prefers regular brew over bold. Since I usually awaken 3 hours before she does, it all works out. She gets her coffee the way she wants and I get mine. We agree that the flavor of our respective brands of coffee is superior to any coffee maker we‚Äôve had before and that our coffee is now smoother than before. We both drink a full 12 cup pot of coffee in the mornings. I always did but now she does too. The removable water reservoir is convenient, especially for my wife. We do not have a permanent filter yet but intend to do so. No doubt the build in lip to prevent grounds being poured into cups will be appreciated.  Neither of us use the programmable feature. She appreciates the pause and serve feature. My only quibble concerns pouring that first cup. Unless I am careful, coffee dribbles onto the counter top. After a cup of coffee is poured out this is not a concern for me. When this coffee maker dies on us, it is very probable our replacement will be another Hamilton-Beach. This coffee maker is well worth the price. UPDATE: The above was submitted not too long after we received the coffee maker. Recently as of November 5, 2017, we lost the ability to change the brew options. We aren't even sure what option is selected as the options display is blank, not even the shadow of the options in the window. All we know is the 1 - 4 cup option is not selected. The coffee is still excellent, but we wonder if this has failed, what is next? Considering this failure we have changed our rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.We are glad we held on to our old coffee maker.November 19, 2017 and the ability to select time length of warming plate has disappeared.

Also, I will add in this edit a favorable comment about the no-spill carafe - it's great  The carafe on my previous unit, Mr. Coffee, always spilled when I used it to fill the H20 tank.

I noticed some people complain about the steam coming out of the top and damaging their cabinets. That‚Äôs a problem with just about every coffee maker. What I do is just put a paper towel over the steam vent and that takes care of that.  I looked at Consumer reports and they rate/recommend coffee makers first by the optimal brewing temperature. The temp needs to be from 195 to 205 degrees to make the best cup of coffee. They tested over a hundred different ones. Don‚Äôt know if they tested this one or not. The ones they did recommend (and that was only 7 out of a 100) ranged from $170 to $40 which just goes to show that price doesn‚Äôt always matter.

Looked at some higher-end coffee makers, but decided to stick with this one because it's such a great value with some nice features. What I love about it: * the removable water carafe is easy to fill, easy to read and easy to clean (I leave the reservoir open on the counter to dry out each day, run the other components thru the dishwasher after each use, and run a cleaning cycle with white vinegar thru the machine once a month) * the wheels on the bottom of the machine make it easy to pull out from the back of the counter for filling and brewing, then back again when not in use * small footprint, and a nice-looking machine * controls are fairly easy to use What I DON'T like: * this coffee maker didn't come with ANY filter, permanent or even a starter pack of paper filters (my last HB machine came with a permanent gold filter), nor did I find anything in the manual about what filter is recommended. Be advised the HB 80675 Permanent Gold Mesh Filter sold on Amazon does NOT work with this machine (at least it didn't for me); I've gone back to using an old gold filter (not the one that came with my last machine -- that one didn't hold up well) and may just switch to paper * while the machine makes good coffee at 8 cups or more, the quality deteriorates when you make a smaller pot of coffee * the indicator lights seem backwards to me: the Brew light is red and the Program light is green. This is a minor issue, but to me it would be more intuitive for the Brew light to be green (which says 'on' or 'go' to me) and the Program light to be red or yellow",Well-designed and a good value,Amazon,7

Timer is straightforward, the detachable refilling option is helpful, and I like the 'keep warm' button option.

All in all, a pretty good pot of coffee.

I ran it through two cleaning cycles (even though the 'clean me' LED wasn't lit) but things didn't improve. Some research revealed bitter coffee results when the heating element isn't hot enough. A meat thermometer in the brewing basket confirmed this to be true. So, it was time to buy another coffee maker, but which one? A trip to The Wirecutter website revealed some pretty exotic coffee makers at the $200 price point. However, all of them had their flaws. I assumed that the manufactures would make improvements, but didn't have time to wait for next years models to come out. Then I discovered the same site had run tests on less expensive coffee makers. This one (or, more precisely, last year's version, the 46201 model) won the competition, and it was much cheaper than a Cuisinart. So I ordered this one, and, long story short it makes a terrific cup of coffee. LIKE: innovative design (removable water reservoir, wheels, three brewing cycles), great tasting coffee, dishwasher-safe filter basket and carafe. DON'T LIKE: steam vent means I have to move the coffee maker out from under my cabinet, water reservoir only shows even cups of water, One area that requires some additional comments: the manual hints of an optional water filter, and the Hamilton Beach website lists the 80674R Water Filter Pods and Handle as the correct accessory for this coffee maker. But Amazon only carries the 80674, and the seller confirmed that it doesn't fit the 46201 coffee maker, see here: Hamilton Beach Coffeemaker Water Filter Replacement Pods and Handle for BrewStation & Stay or Go (80674) To sum up, I don't believe you can currently buy the perfect coffee maker for any amount of money. However, this model makes a great cup of coffee and sells for a reasonable price. I am happy with my purchase,and would buy this model again. Also, if you want to learn more about how to hard it is to make a decent cup of coffee, Google 'Coffee Brewing Control Chart' and search for images.

The lift off tank in the rear is a game changer.

Next comes the filter and filter cone. Again, a well thought out idea, access is simply via a push button release on the right side of the machine opening a swing out door holding the filter and cone. Filter basket lifts out with a fold over handle making transport of wet grinds to the trash easy and clean. Brew option of making a stronger pot of coffee with a slower drip, is again another  nice option. Lastly, the digital screen is clear and has a great blue color.

I like that it swivels, which makes it easier to fill with water. A couple of tips:  1) You can't have it brewing right under your cabinets or the vent on top will get your cabinets wet.  Pull the maker out to set up and brew and push it back under your cabinets after it's done brewing.  2) If you remove the water reservoir to fill rather than pouring the water in from the carafe, you have to make sure the reservoir is firmly pressed back into place, or it will brew very slowly/improperly.",Good coffee maker for the price,Amazon,107

1088,Hamilton Beach,"April 4, 2017","Hamilton Beach 46205 Programmable, Coffee Maker, Standard",B01N7VIDWY,5,"Update to original review. Good news, you can reset the coffee warmer simply by pushing the power on button as though you were going to brew another pot, I've tried it 5 times with no bad effects, and get another 2 hours of hot coffee. 2 issues I founfd though. 1) no Beep to signal when the coffee is done. I've never heard one on mine anyway, and I miss it. Now I have to check for dripping to see if its done. 2) the swivel roller can be a pain if your counter is not very smooth and clean. Any stray coffee grounds can make the roller stop. Neither of these 2 issues affected the rating since I still love the brewer. Original review I like this coffee maker. It‚Äôs so well thought out that it leaves me thinking that maybe some manufacturers are reading reviews and using them for improvement ideas. Genius. The sort of bad. The only things that I find questionable are the 2 hour warming limit, and the filter release button. The 2 hour auto shut off can‚Äôt be reset. 2 hours is ok in most instances, but there are many days it takes me 4 or 5 hours to finish a pot. My old coffee maker I just press and hold a button for a few seconds and it would reset the auto shut off count. Not this one 2 hours is it then you need to start reheating in the micro wave, or brew smaller batches. Either choice results in more work for the user, which is a negative. As for the filter release button, the latch and button are holding up fine for now, it‚Äôs been about 3 weeks of daily use so far, but I can see no reason to have the basket released by the push of a button. Any other coffee maker I‚Äôve ever had you just give it a firm tug to pull it out, and I can‚Äôt figure out why they changed it. In my experience the first thing to break in a product is the latch that is used on a daily basis, and I would expect this to be the weak spot in the future. For now its fine though, so it won‚Äôt hurt my review, I will update as needed. I would have taken half a star for the warming limit but since that‚Äôs not possible I kept it at 5 stars because the price point is very nice. The good The coffee maker has a lot going for it. I love the trend of the removable water reservoirs where you don‚Äôt have to pour any water. I always hated water getting everywhere during the transfer. Now it‚Äôs straight from the sink to inserting in the coffee machine. I also like the temperature setting for warming, I can make my coffee less warm on days I expect to take longer to drink it, so it doesn‚Äôt burn, and on my high demand days I can set it extra hot without worry letting sit on higher heat too long. I drink my coffee strong and I have always found to brew it the strength I like it takes 14 to 20 minutes, this machine does it in almost exactly 15.5 minutes with a full water tank so that‚Äôs right in the expected range. This is the first time I‚Äôve found a swivel base on a coffee maker, and it is very handy. The coffee maker can be positioned in places not readily convenient in other makers since you don‚Äôt have to pull it out to get to the water tank. The controls are all pretty standard, and it looks stylish with its black and stainless appearance. Overall a welcome addition to my kitchen, at a very affordable price.","Convenient, stylish, well thought out coffee maker.",Amazon,6

They actually did put some thought into improving the design on this one. First off, it is smaller than my other one even though it still has the 12 cup capacity. The water reservoir lifts out for easy cleaning and filling, but water can also be added without removing the reservoir and it's easier to see the levels. The push button basket is a neat touch. The only caveat is that the removal basket needs to align the 4 lines on the basket with the 2 grooves. You will know what I'm talking about once you remove the basket and try to put it back in. The swivel bottom is really cool, and everything seems to be designed better. The coffee pot glides in and out of the coffee maker with ease. It doesn't catch on the overflow valve on the basket and the nonstick warming plate probably helps with this process. I was excited to see the warming button, but I think it only adjusts the temperature of the warming function. I would like a coffee maker with a button to turn the warming on and off. Sometimes, I drink my coffee slow and when I go for another cup it's been past two hours and the coffee is cold. I understand the reason behind the 2 hour shutoff, but a warming button that could be turned off and on if wanted would be nice. Still this is an awesome little coffee maker, and I'm really happy with it.","Great design, I really like it",Amazon,5

That is an important feature to me.  I also like the auto-off feature (keeps warm and turns off after 2 hours.)

However, the scale function leaves a lot to be desired.  It's rather difficult to get the top lid to open up (I would expect it should open with ease since it's an often-used part of the coffee maker) and the scale is more times wrong than right.  We don't even go by the scale anymore, we just know how many scoops to add. Otherwise, the coffee maker makes decent coffee - and the carafe seems to be of good quality.  I do like the large number readout as well for time of day.","Decent coffeemaker, but scale is a bell and whistle not needed.",Amazon,2

It has a 'sneak-a-cup' feature (pour a cup during brewing).  It has a carafe that pours without dripping (just don't try to pour too much, too fast).  It has a keep-warm hot plate (turns off automatically after 2 hours).  It has a removeable tank, marked with water levels for desired number of cups, for kitchen-faucet filling (easy to remove and replace).  It has little rollers for easy shifting on a kitchen countertop (very helpful in a big coffeemaker).  It's got 4-to-12-cup coffeemaking capacity, with adjustable brew strength (brew strength feature really works).  And it's programmable (have your coffee ready when you get up in the morning). Best of all, this is an extremely well-made, reliable, and durable coffeemaker.  My coffeemaker purchased in April 2015--used daily to brew 1-2 pots--is still going strong!  This is already longer than my other coffeemakers have lasted, so I ordered another one to keep in reserve while the same model is still available.

All I wanted was an easy to fill receptacle.  Our last appliance had a middle section built inside the reservoir that interfered with water filling--splashing was inevitable.  This is such an improvement‚Äîthe swivel bottom smoothly moves the appliance in any direction for easy back access, and the reservoir readily separates from the base for quick faucet fills.  It also attaches back on with ease.  The reservoir can also be filled by simply using the carafe.  Either method is mess-free because the top lid opens wide and there is absolutely nothing inside the reservoir to get in the way while filling. The rest of the appliance is just as straightforward.  It has a keep warm feature and several brewing options (bold/regular strength and 1-4 cup mode).  Hamilton Beach recommends brewing decaffeinated coffee when using the bold or 1-4 cup option.  If no option is selected, the machine will default to regular strength and keep warm mode at the warmest temperature setting.  The unit will automatically shut off in two hours.  It can also be preprogrammed for specific on/off times. All I ask from a coffee pot is fresh tasting coffee, ease of use, and a carafe that doesn‚Äôt spill while pouring coffee.  This one does all that, and at a reasonable price.  I like simple features that all work well. The first photo highlights the four white swiveled feet that rotate on the appliance‚Äôs bottom.

Another very subtle feature of this coffeemaker design is the discharge point from the carafe.  When pouring the first cup very slowly from a full carafe, there is a tendency for a few drops of coffee ‚Äúdribble‚Äù along the outside of the carafe.  The carafe for this machine uses a sharp crested edge which protrudes slightly more than typical from the edge of the carafe preventing this condition.

I'm on a fixed income and drink 3 or 4 cups a day so k-cups would be expensive for me not to mention how anti-green they are.

After some comparison shopping I decided on the Cuisinart SS-10. It had very good reviews and I have other Cuisinart appliances and have always found them to be well made and reliable. Also the price was right. The Cuisinart was about half the price of a Keurig that had the same features plus it had a 3 year warranty.

The feature I most miss from the SS-700 is the soft blue lit up water container when turning the unit on.  The SS-10 no longer has the light.  Bummer.  Otherwise the SS-10 is a simpler head compartment design and less likely to break and malfunction.  It takes a little getting used to at first but it works flawlessly.  Also, with the SS-10 it's ready to brew the moment you turn it on.  With other brands, including the Keurig brands, you must wait several minutes for warmup before and after each brew.  Overall this is still the best out there imo.  Different than the SS-700, some positive differences and some negative differences (mainly cosmetic such as the water light) but still a very good choice and it's affordable and nice looking.",Yes it's not the SS-700 but......,Amazon,0

Having seen a lot of negative reviews of the new Keurig machines, I decided on the Cuisinart based on mostly favorable reviews. I guess I should have paid more attention to the handful of reviews that mentioned that coffee splashes EVERYWHERE when you brew a cup with this machine. What a mess! Coffee splashed all over the counter, all over the machine itself, and even on the floor. Did anyone at Cuisinart even try this machine before putting it on the market? Also, it made a ridiculous amount of noise when brewing. I would liken it to the sound of one of those small, cheap air pumps that plug into a cigarette lighter for inflating kids pool toys - in other words, loud. NOT the mark of a quality machine. So, I sent it straight back to Amazon and picked up a new Keurig Elite machine locally. At least based on first impressions, the Keurig seems to use mostly higher-quality materials, is definitely a lot quieter, and doesn't make a mess.

I did a lot of research for what various coffee makers functions included and most did not only lack many of the features but were extremely over priced. For just myself, the Cuisinart SS10 was for me with the features I wanted.  It also comes with the universal holder & filter for your particular coffee. The biggest issue I had with other makers; most came with only the Kcup size holder.  No filter for your coffee, that was extra (about $5). My taste and maybe yours as well, require about two scoops of my favorite coffee and the most holder/filters will only hold one scoop.  Problem solved, Cuisinart SS10 holds two scoops. My only issue is the cleaning of the holder/filter after each brew.  I did order a pack of four but will still have to clean as each is served.  Having paper filters is like buying an expensive power tool; about $9 per hundred and only hold single scoop....

I took the screen and used in another filter.  I've read many reviews that also stated the filter holder would easily break and mine did as well only thought it would last longer.

1230,Cuisinart,"December 2, 2018","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,4,"I did quite a bit of research on K-cup coffermakers. I relied on the Cuisinart name to some extent for this purchase.  I'm basically happy with it.  There are a lot of features that I like and some not.  Although the construction quality is decent, I didn't expect so much 'chrome-colored' plastic.  I expected some metal in a Cuisinart product.  The K-cup holder system doesn't swing down like the Kuerig-branded models I've had.  The Kuerig models are deigned with a cantilevered holder so that when you open the holder lever, the holder compartment flips down about 30 degrees to provide nice angle to insert the K-cup.  Not so with this one.  The holder is at a fixed angle, so that inserting and removing K-cups is a bit more cumbersome.  Althtough I like that there is an included DYI single serve filter (in a cool little hide-a-way compartment), I expected it to be a refillable K-cup holder.  But it's a complete replacement of the holder and a separate open filter cup.  I don't like having to switch back and forth between the two 'systems' to use K-cups and using my own grounds.  I like that there are 5 cup sizes.  Although there are separate buttons for 'Brew', 'Hot Water', and 'Rinse', there isn't much functional difference between them.  If you only want hot water or want to rinse the system, you still have to open and close the K-cup lid to 'reset' the 'Brew', 'Hot Water', or 'Rinse' buttons to use them.  There is NO difference between 'Brew' and 'Hot Water' as far as I can tell.  The serving size is the same, the water temp is the same, and the water is dispensed through the same spout.  So, if you wanted Hot Water and you have an old K-cup still in the K-cup holder, you're going to get diluted coffee instead.  So Cuisinart!  What's the point of the separate buttons?  The 'Rinse' button seems to dispense about half the water volume, but is otherwise the same. My final complaint is that although, unlike the Kuerig models I've had, you can select water temperature (seems like a good feature), even the 'X-Hot' isn't all that hot.  The optimum coffee brewing temp is supposed to be 190 F (I forget where I read that), even the hottest temp is cooler than that. So, I generally like this K-cup maker, it could be better.","Decent K-cup maker, but not the construction quality or thoughful design I expect from Cuisinart",Amazon,0

It seems to be a bit more generous with the water, which takes some getting used to, but it's a nice change from the basic model I had last. It comes with a water reservoir filter, which is an extra you have to buy with the others. And I really like that it heats the water as it dispenses.

I had a cusinart k cup brewer that I bought in 2011 and it worked great and lasted 7 years.  I replaced it with this machine as after 7 years of use it couldn't brew any more.  I took care of that machine (descaled it and cleaned it regularly even if the descale signal had not turned on) and it worked great.  If the descale signal was on I cleaned it and the signal went off and the machine worked great.  I was happy with Cusinart brand brewer so I got a comparable cusinart k cup brewer (newer model) to replace it after 7 years of use. This newer machine is terrible.  It is noisy, very noisy.  It takes a full 2 1/2 minutes to brew a 12 oz cup of coffee.  I have timed it.  I can empty trash, put laundry in the washer and dryer, and load breakfast dishes into the dishwasher and this thing still hasn't finished making a cup of coffee.  The coffee splashes and sputters and drips out so slowly it is highly annoying.  The worst part of all is that after having the machine for 4 months the descale signal turned on. I used Vinegar and followed the directions to descale and the signal would not turn off.  I called the company and they said descale it again, So I did. Still the signal remains.  They said unplug the machine to reset it,  That did not work.  I complained about the splashy, sputtering, noisy, slow brewing also.  They replaced it with a new one.  The replacement is also splashy, sputtery, noisy and slow as a sloth.  I dealt with it.  I descaled it after two months of use even though the signal was not on to be proactive as I had been with my 2011 version.  The replacement machine is about 4 months old and the descale signal turned on although I recently descaled it. So I descaled it and the signal again will not turn off.  That in itself could be ignored but the other problems with the machine are really the problem.  That and the fact that the descale signal is obviously not accurate Make this machine a bad purchase.  Eventually I'll get a different brand.  Going to call the company again, as this one is still under the original warranty of the first one I purchased.

Anyway the coffee is very weak unless I brew 4 oz. servings, and even then it isn't strong, just not as weak. The 'Extra Hot' setting is way, way far from 'extra hot' - in fact plain old 'hot' is pushing it. Luckily I don't like coffee stupidly hot, or even kind of hot, because if I did, this machine would surely not be making it. It's what I would call luke-hot or just warm. The weakness of the coffee is a deal breaker for me. I have to brew three 4 oz. cups each morning for my travel mug. Totally F that. I am using the strongest K Cups I could find but it's still the weakest coffee I ever had, bar the bilge water from gas stations etc.... I am going back to my Mr Coffee and throwing half a pot out every day. At least I'll get coffee worth drinking. I am just sorry I wasted the money on this and 2 cases of K Cups. In other news, it does work well (minus the water masquerading as coffee thing) it's noisy and made of cheap plastic. Again, I fully expected Cuisinart to be a whole lot better than this.

We gave up on Keurig and most recently had an iCoffee Mozart which lasted almost 2 years by itself before succumbing to a failed pump as well. Please note that we make 4-5 cups every day, always use filtered water, and de-scale with vinegar at regular intervals eliminating the possibility of water quality being a cause of failure. We decided to purchase the Cuisinart SS-10 model hoping that maybe the Cuisinart name and quality would provide us a coffee maker that lasts more than 2 years. We have other Cuisinart small appliances that we are very happy with. The pros: Nice looking machine with a rather small footprint... doesn't take the larger space required for the iCoffee. Holds a generous amount of water reducing the need to refill often. Makes a very hot cup of coffee when compared to Keurig or iCoffee. We have our setting on XHOT. We use flavored coffees as well as tea or hot chocolate making the rinse feature a welcome addition.... rinse between different beverages so there is no cross contamination. Water heats up very fast. Automatic on and off settings making it ready to brew when we get up in the morning and shuts off right after we leave. Removable spill tray at the bottom making it easy to fit a tall aluminum To Go cup underneath. Great range of coffee sizes 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces. The cons: Doesn't have the sturdy strong feeling of other coffee machines.... a little too much 'plastic' feel. We notice that this machine splashes a bit more.... not sure why.... maybe the rate at which it flows. This machine does seem to brew a little slower when compared to others but not terribly so. It also seems just a bit louder than the iCoffee brewer we had before. Our icoffee machine had a water tank that had a very pleasing blue light illuminating it making it very easy to see the water level.... this machine has no water tank illumination making it a little harder to see the water level. Overall, we are satisfied so far and are hoping that the Cuisinart quality will hold true and provide us a coffee brewer that will last for several years and provide reliable, consistent performance. The coffee maker is one of those appliances that is taken for granted and rarely gets noticed until it doesn't work!

While replacing yet another dead Keurig, the floor manager at Bed Bath and Beyond finally asked my sister-in-law why she kept replacing her Keurigs instead of just getting a Cuisinart.  He then explained the differences in the high quality of materials which go into the Cuisinart against the cheaper parts of the Keurig, not to mention a much longer warranty. I used their Cuisinart a couple of times and did a little online research and found that guy knew what he was talking about.

In most respects, the quality of the unit (e.g., feel + function) appear to be diminished (e.g., someone turned the cost-reduction engineers loose on the design).  As you can see in the photos I have provided, the 2012 unit had a very different design of the K-Cup holder (i.e., the 2012 unit had a larger hole and cross-bar at the bottom, and the 2018 is simply a bare, smaller hole) such that the 2018 unit causes the liquid to 'dribble' out of it (as other reviewers have noted), thus 'splashing' all over the back of the cup area, and to the sides and front, beyond the unit, making a mess.  Further, the old 2012 base (where the cup sits) was about 5' deep, and the new 2018 unit's cup base is much smaller.  I have a 20-Oz Starbucks aluminum coffee mug.  So, I have always made my coffee, with the 2012 unit, in a 32-Oz Pyrex Measuring cup (i.e., 12-Oz + 8-Oz = 20-Oz).  No way does the measuring cup fit on this new unit.  To their credit, they did design the new 2018 unit with a lip on the cup base holder, so that it cannot simply slide out--which was a flaw in the old design.  All things considered, I can see where many people will not like like this new 2018 Cuisinart unit, primarily as a function of the 'dribble' + 'splash' issue--which prompted my 1-Star Rating.

I have not been around any other brand in operation, so I can't compare the noise level except to say this one is noisier than it's predecessors. The one advantage this unit offers over most of its competitors is the number of different sizes it will produce: five sizes ranging from 4oz to 12oz in two-ounce increments. That makes it handy for all sorts of things in the kitchen. It also has a convenient adaptor for making tea or whatever else you can imagine brewing.

I clean it, I unclog it, I stick a paper clip down the sharp needle like people advise, I wipe out all the grounds embedded everywhere (which is problematic because none of the parts are removable) and I use the rinse setting on the machine.

So far it has performed flawlessly. To me, it's plenty fast enough and whatever noise it makes isn't enough to disturb my early morning quiet time. I like that you can use the supplied cup to use your own coffee if plastic waste is a concern. I also like that I can purchase k-cups that my town's recycling program accepts. The big reservoir is a plus, as is the included water filter. The coffee comes out tasting wonderful. The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is because even though the coffee comes out really hot (I use the extra-hot setting as opposed to normal), I'm one of those would like it hotter still! The coffee does seem to cool off quicker than I would like since I use cream & tend to linger over a cup, so I use an insulated cup and that works well. Other people have mentioned that coffee or water tends to spash everywhere & make a mess. Haven't seen too much of that myself unless I put it on the rinse mode, but even then it's just a few stray water droplets on the counter. All in all, I'm thrilled with the performance of this machine for the time I've had it. ***UPDATE 12/10/18***Changed my rating to a 2. I like my coffee hot, and this unit started out performing acceptably in that regard. Unfortunately, it's now producing coffee that's only about 159 degrees when first dispensed whether I use the HOT or the X-TRA HOT setting--WAY off base. Add a little half & half from the fridge, & the beginning temp is more like 149 degrees. The coffee cools down extremely fast now, even in an insulated mug.

First off, my typical commuter mugs won't fit even when you remove the drip tray!  Second, the coffee comes out slooooooow.  Frankly, we replaced our beloved Keurig brewer because that pump started to struggle (even after de-scaling), but the new Cuisinart isn't much faster.  If you are a coffee nut like me then you know that the waiting is the hardest part!  Also, the menu design is....stupid.  If you want to increase the serving size with the up/down buttons it's counter-intuitive that you push the up button on the left and the down on the right!  As a minor gripe, it's hard to know at a glance if the maker is on (especially from the side) unless you can see the menu lit. On the positive side, the water reservoir is huge, and the coffee is hot.  The serving sizes are flexible.  It looks nice.  We got this Cuisinart during a great sale, so it was significantly less expensive than the Keurig, but long-term I might find this was a penny-wise, pound-foolish decision.  If you don't use tall commuter mugs, and if you aren't in a hurry, and if you don't change your default serving size often, and don't program your maker to automatically turn off, then you'll probably be pleased with this maker. Update 15 Oct 2018: One more positive, one more negative to discuss.  On the positive side, unlike the Keurig, this works like an instant hot, so you don't need to wait for the heating element if it was turned off.  Of course, it still comes out slow as i described earlier, but you can hit brew and do other things till it's finished.  Now for the additional negative - unlike the Keurig, it doesn't seem to pump the pod empty but rather it leaves a few loose drops consistently in the bottom of the pod and when you remove the pod it almost always drips coffee.  You can catch those drips in your hand, or you can find yourself wiping them off the counter, or worse you can find them dripping on your work clothes.....  After a while you get used to the drips and you prepare for them, but it's still a bother.  Other than that, the Cuisinart is still running fine with daily use.","Tall travel mugs don't fit, and a few other gripes.",Amazon,1

Like many I purchased it to replace the discontinued 700 model which served me for many years.  This is a cheap downsized piece of plastic and is lacking in many ways compared to the 700. It is smaller and lighter due to more and lighter plastic.  Some may say smaller is good - less counter space.  No smaller and lighter means you must hold the coffee maker in place when you push the brew button or it scoots all over your counter. The loading head is now all plastic and does not open like 'jaws'.  The head top opens but you now have to look down into the loading area as opposed to looking straight in.  Also the loading head has a fake plastic chromed top that does nothing but show fingerprints and smears.  The old metal head was a brushed finished that did not show fingerprints and smudges.  Also this head feels and sounds cheap right out of the box.  I expect it to break in a few months. Gone is the nice blue light that used to light up the water reservoir.  And without the light there is no blinking light to tell you to add water.  With this new unlit reservoir you can't easily see the water level if the coffee maker is in a dark corner. Even the brew function buttons were cheapened.  The 700 model had partial sculptured circles the 10 has ugly rectangles and squares. The water pump sounds anemic, takes longer and as other have said creates splashing because it comes out more of a dribble than stream. Even the base where you place the mug has shrunk.  My very large mug now hangs over the front of the base. I could list more items of difference, but you probably get the point.  It is highly likely if you are replacing a 700 model thinking this will be the same, you will be disappointed.  I understand wanting to make a less costly model, but they should have kept the 700 for those of us that wanted a better, more solid product. Since the product works I honestly have a problem returning it so will keep it. Not the sellers fault and if I had done more research I would have found what I have reported in this review. It comes with a 3 year warranty that I expect will be needed although online reviews indicate it is difficult to get a warranty response.

Now having said all of that, here goes. My Wife and I Love This Coffee Maker. We've only had it a month, but it works as advertised. We love the feature of changing cup sizes. The Wife drinks from a 12oz cup, where I drink 18oz. Sure it takes a little longer since I have to reset the cup size down to 6oz, but for Great Tasting Coffee, to me, it's worth it. We love the convenience of the Pods. However, when we bought it, we had 2 big cans of Maxwell House Coffee that we are using the Barista Cup for. Now, the Barista Cup works great. But as you can imagine, it is a little inconvenient. You have to dump out the coffee grinds and then rinse out the Barista Cup to re-use. So once we drink up what we have, we will go to using the Pods. The only downside for us is the Water Tank. As advertised it has a 70oz tank versus other brands that may have a 40oz or a 64oz tank. And we laugh about the claim that with a 70oz tank you don't have to fill it as often versus the other brands. Now they are right about that, except for us. You see that claim is true for a One Cup a Day Coffee Drinker. But the Wife and I are all day long, Coffee Drinkers! Of course, that is no big deal to us. Since with the BUNN, someone had to add a pot of water to get a pot of coffee out of it. So in closing, let me say, 'Buy It, You'll Love It'!",It's So Easy to Use,Amazon,1

Since I have very limited counter space, I opted, at first, for a cheap (and small) machine... but it did not work well at all. Then I found the Cuisinart SS-10. (It's about the size of the Keurig I used to have... possibly a little wider, but less deep and slightly shorter). I've had it about 7 months now.. and it gets plenty of use.  Amazingly it has not clogged once.  And I've cleaned it much less often than I should.  It also heats up WAY faster than any Keurig machine I've used.  In fact, I'd say it heats up a little hotter than the Keurig machines did--but that just means my coffee is the right temperature once I've added creamer to it.  The refillable K-cup it comes with is also handy for when you want to use regular coffee grounds (which my husband does)--and I like that it's stored neatly out of the way in a side panel. If I could change anything about it--it would be that I wish the water reservoir was on the right side instead of the left (my faucet sprayer does not quite reach to the right side), but this is an extremely minor inconvenience.  (The reservoir is removable for refilling--which my husband does.  I tend to just move the entire machine so it's halfway over the sink and the sprayer reaches.  But, the machine is light enough that this is not really a difficult). So far, I'm very happy with this coffee maker.",The refillable K-cup it comes with is also handy for when you want to use regular coffee grounds (which my husband does)--and I like that it's stored neatly out of the way in ...,Amazon,0

I mindlessly ordered this thinking that I was getting the level quality of product I currently had. Boy was I wrong. While this is smaller and lighter (read cheaper construction) this is louder, takes longer to complete, 'spits' the water out intermittently instead of a steady stream, the water tank is difficult to seat properly and of all things the 4 oz brew produces 5 oz!!!!

I decided to try a different brand and purchased the Cuisinart.  I've had it about a year now, and it's still going strong so we'll see if it lasts longer than the competition. Pros: I love the look of the Cusinart so much more. Nice styling. I like the readout. It has a nifty storage compartment for the reusable pod holder. But, most of all, I LOVE that it sits under my cabinets, and I don't have to pull it out to open the pod holder. When the household is busy, our old coffeemaker was always pulled out, taking up precious counter space and looking untidy. Con: Because of the shorter profile, my 16 oz. mugs won't fit under the dispenser with the drip tray in place. That's not a major issue for me. I place a coaster to catch the occasional drip. Can't have everything.  If the coffeemaker were taller, I'd have to pull it out from under the cabinets to use it, so I'm happy with this tradeoff.","Sleek, Attractive, and Works Well",Amazon,0

I‚Äôve had I almost a year and while I liked it in the beginning, it just does not seem to suit my family. We had a traditional coffee maker for years and wanted to try the single serve style and this one seemed like one of the best on the market at the time. We have a family of 4 and the single serve takes a while to get everyone threw where as the carafe style was a simple pour and move on. The flavor of the coffee is subpar as it really does not hold much flavor. The cups meant for it are not good and taste like instant coffee and occasionally you still get grains of the mix. The fill with your own beans canister has been the only thing to keep this product in our kitchen for as long as it‚Äôs stayed because it makes decent coffee but still not comparable to a carafe coffee maker. It makes a mess when it‚Äôs dispensing into the cup which you have to wipe off of the counter and drips a bit after you take your cup out so you have to clean the drip catch constantly. One thing I love about this coffee maker though is that it is instantly hot, unlike some Keuregs that I have used. There is no wait time between turning the machine on and pressing brew. Instant hot water though is not enough for me though and I will defiantly be switching back to a traditional coffee maker.

Works just as well as the Keurig, but allows for more options on cup sizes and no wait time to heat. Does the coffee splatter when brewing? Yes, but so did the Keurig.

When SS-10 number 2 arrived, I unpacked it and looked at the brew head.  Still no blade in the brew head, just a round, not very sharp piece of plastic, like the first one!  And once again, the first - and second, and third - cups were bludgeoned to death and varying amounts of grounds were in each cup!

First the good, it is fast and fairly quiet, so far so good the coffee is great as always. The not so good - the new opening mechanism is not as high quality, feels cheaper and not as sturdy, the plastic insert that you put the pod into comes out with the pod sometimes and it no longer tips forward at an angle so is not quite as slick to load and unload. The blue flashing light that reminds you it is low on water is gone. The buttons to change the cup size seem to spin and are difficult to 'spin' back when they end up sitting sideways which is annoying. The most disappointing change is the water filter which appears to be a 'why bother' now that it sits perched up on top of the water intake - as if the water is going to come through the filter when it can just be sucked in below it? There is no fitting, it does not sit over the intake like the old one did, just perched on top of it on the plastic of the filter holder (with no opening to meet up with it).

The second one suddenly began taking five minutes to dribble out a 6-oz. cup of coffee. I wanted the biggest water reservoir I could find because refilling it is a hassle for us.  I compared all the Keurig, Bunn, Mr. Coffee, and Hamilton-Beach models I could find before deciding on the Cuisinart.  I wanted the simplest one I could find. WHY I CHOSE THIS ONE - 72-oz. reservoir. - Options for not only auto turn-on time and serving size, but also brew temperature. - It has a water filter that fits into the reservoir. - While Cuisinart coffee-makers generally aren't highly regarded, their other appliances are. PROS - It's fast.  From the moment I drop in the coffee, close the lid, and push the 'Brew' button, it takes less than 45 seconds for me to have a fresh, hot cup of coffee. - It accepts all K-cups, including my compostable-biodegradable ones. - The water reservoir is large enough that we don't have to keep filling it. - The water filter is integrated into the reservoir, so I don't need to use my Brita pitcher or fridge water. - The coffee is good.  The hottest brew temp, which I prefer, made a cup that my husband said was bitter, so we have it on the second-hottest setting and it works fine. - Several people complained about how it spatters coffee.  I see a few drops - more than my old Keurigs ever made - but I wipe the counter after use anyway.  Maybe as it gets old and decrepit it will spatter more, but for now, I'm not seeing it. - I haven't used the hot water or Rinse features, so can't comment on them.  But people seem to like them. CONS - The same feature that I love - the big water reservoir - means that it's using water that has sat there for a couple of days and is no longer fully fresh.  So the convenience is a possible negative. - The digital screen is flat in the vertical surface, instead of being tilted, so you may have an issue seeing it from above. Overall, I like this machine.

It always says 'OPEN HEAD' even though we have a k-cup in there waiting.  My husband and I have both contacted Cuisinart on separate occasions trying to troubleshoot the problem.  The latest conversation was 'it doesn't show that this coffee maker is programable' and then the only solution I got was to try a factory re-set which is unplugging it for an hour or two and trying it again and that if that doesn't work that Amazon must be selling us lemons.  I know better than that, it is not an Amazon problem, but a product problem.  I did check and all three coffee makers do have the shame 'date packaged' (10/2017) and 'batch #' (2018NO28) so it is possible that they received a bad batch from Cuisinart.  On the flip side, when we manually push the brew button, the cups of coffee have been so much better than our old coffee maker, but they couldn't get much worse either.

After brewing a cup of coffee, water drops hang on the water spout that delivers the coffee to your cup. To me that's germy!

First off, I am so frustrated by coffee makers.  Keurigs were lasting me about a year plus I hate that you have to buy Keurig k-cups.  If you use on Keurig k cups in your Keurig, it eventually breaks so i switched to the icoffee machine.  The first one lasted me less than a year, the second one less than nine months.  Researching it seems icoffee is not in business any longer so now I am trying Cuisinart.  First thing that strikes me, positively, is that it is a slicker, more modern machine than Keurig or icoffee and a smaller footprint, particularly in the height of the machine so less obtrusive on the counter, and less of an eyesore.  But what really stands out to me is how hot it brews, not to mention it is much faster to heat up.  This is one hot cup of coffee which I love.  Twice as hot as Keurig and icoffee.  So time will tell but so far so good.  I remember giving my mother a hard time that her Mr. Coffee was about 20 years old and she still, at her death, used it every day for those 20 years.  She refused to change it out and now, for me,  I am probably close to spending 1,200 on coffee machines in the past 6 years.

I was spoiled with the Breville‚Äôs looks and function and have yet to find anything that compares looks wise, or in dependability. This is MUCH louder than the Breville and after a week of use it does tend to spit coffee around a bit. It wouldn‚Äôt be a deal breaker but it also doesn‚Äôt seem to make as good of a cup of coffee as the Breville or another Keurig I have owned in the past, even using the same water and brand/blend of kcups, and the charcoal filter. And if I‚Äôve only had this a week, it makes me wonder what‚Äôs to come!? I‚Äôll have to keep my fingers crossed because the box was already mistakenly thrown out so no return, I‚Äôm sure. Again, it‚Äôs acceptable but I‚Äôm quite picky on looks AND coffee taste (I drink it black). For reference, I like a bold but smooth blend. My absolute favorites are REVV kcups and Peet‚Äôs Holiday Blend. I will also occasionally use Starbucks Decaf (as I have not found a better kcup Decaf). The taste in this just seems off...maybe the charcoal filter (???) My Breville had their brand of charcoal filters so maybe Cuisinarts are different and tainting the taste (???) who knows. I‚Äôd say if you need a new kcup machine go for it. It‚Äôs at least better looking than the plastic, tired, outdated Keurig machines! UPDATE: I WILL BE RETURNING THIS ITEM.

I did my research and identified the Cuisinart SS-10 as one of the top ranked brewers on a well known consumer testing site, but now that I have it I'm over the moon with some of it's other features. This unit takes K-Cups and has it's own Barista Cup to use your favorite grind (or tea) without the need to purchase pods (it stores inside the SS-10 in a door above the power button). Unboxing was easy. There is minimal assembly required outside of the water filter. Setup took about 30 minutes total - soak the filter, wash the tank, remove all the tape (total time is about 30 minutes because you have to soak the filter for 15 minutes) run a couple of cycles and your ready to brew. I like that this model has a brew, hot water and rinse button allowing for flexibility for people like me that mainly drink other hot beverages like tea. It came with 3 Cuisinart pods, but you can use ground coffee or tea with the included Barista adapter to drive your costs down. You can select the water temperature (XHot or Hot) and the size of the default cup easily between 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 ounces. The water reservoir is pretty easy to handle, but can be a bit awkward when full to the max line. The drip pan removes for cleaning and larger mugs. My larger 24 ounce Turvis mug won't fit, but the smaller 12 oz. fits nicely. You can still use the larger mug by simply using a smaller cup and pouring the liquid into the larger cup. I don't use the timer since it isn't used frequently and the time to heat the water is not long. Brew times are very quick from cup to cup. It has only been a few days, but I am impressed.

The coffee it brews has a nice flavor to it, better than what I owned previously.  However, the mechanism you lift and depress to insert the K-Cups has a real gritty, jerky feel to it and is not smooth at all.  Perhaps it will become smoother with time?  We'll see.  The most noticeable issue for me is the noise level it makes when it actually brews the coffee.  In my opinion it is excessively loud.  My former Coffee Brewer was much quieter in that regard.

The SS-700 lasted almost 6 1/2 years, which is far better than my earlier 1 cup units. Unfortunately, I have to say the SS-700 was better. For one thing, when you close the SS-10's handle on a K-cup, it feels and sounds like the mechanism is about to break. It feels flimsy. Plus, the SS-700 allowed you to select a brewing temperature between 187 and 192 degrees F, and the coffee was HOT. The SS-10 has only HOT and XHOT selections and, sadly, even with the XHOT setting the coffee temp measures only 140 degrees. Once I add creamer it's down to 130. That's barely warm. In just a few minutes I'm looking to nuke the cup in the microwave. On a lesser note, I miss the SS-700's blue LEDs shining up into the water reservoir, making it easier to see the current level.

I was so excited when it arrived as I had gone without my favorite coconut coffee for 3 days.  I go to brew my first cup of coffee and notice how clumsy the mechanism is that holds the K-cup.  It is too rigid during opening and requires an inordinate amount of pressure to close.  Not nearly as fluid as the old units mechanism.  It almost gives the impression of one of those hideous push to pop out trays on toaster ovens that you have to press 6x to get it to stay.  I select the 10oz cup size, as always, and brew my first cup of coffee in my favorite 12 oz. cup which should leave plenty of room for cream.  It vibrates so loudly while brewing that I think to myself that I won't be able to make a cup at 4am without waking the whole house.  It splatters coffee all over me, my counter and itself.  I quickly grab 2 round lids from my Ziploc storage jars to create a raised platform for my cup.  My cup fills.  My cup overflows.  While I'm wiping up the mess, and pouring out the excess coffee from my cup, the unit refills and again it vibrates the entire counter.  It shows ready to go.  I sit down and drink my watered down cup of coffee thinking to myself that I must have pressed the wrong button and will be more careful next time.  I go to get another cup and again, it overflows.  Not me!  In summary; the cup size calibration is wrong, its noisy as hell, makes a damn mess and is clumsy to operate.

1776,Cuisinart,"February 20, 2018","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,1,"I bought this to replace a wonderful Cuisinart SS-700, which, after many years of heavy, heavy use and faithful service, finally, sadly, gave up the ghost. First of all, this SS-10 makes excellent coffee. I have no complaints about that. Really excellent coffee. However, this seems to be a flimsy replacement for the venerable SS-700, which is no longer made. The reservoir is smaller, though the unit is, overall smaller, which is nice. The lid which you close to pierce the K-cup, is, instead of a solid, mostly metal lever, that uses the lever to greatly ease the piercing of the K-cup, a flimsy, plastic 'thing,' which I would estimate has a lifetime of about 10% of the one on the SS-700. If I'm proven wrong, I'll retract this review and gladly eat crow. There is no blue light below the water reservoir. That would be OK, but there is also no blue flashing light  when the water is too low. You have to rely on the status screen to the right, to tell you when to add water, which is 10% sooner than with the SS-700. Maybe this unit will last as long as the SS-700. But if the observable shortcomings are reflected within the unit, I'm afraid it won't. If I could have bought a new SS-700 instead of this flimsy piece of equipment, I would gladly have paid any up-charge. PRODUCT UPDATE: After using this for a couple months, I am even more disappointed it it and in Cuisinart (I have Cuisinart drip coffeemakers at 2 homes, this at one and an SS-700 at another, 2 different Cuisinart toasters, a can opener, etc.). The only thing I can say about this is that it makes great coffee. However, compared to the SS-700 it replaced, it does it MUCH slower, MUCH louder, and it overfills the cups compared to the SS-700. It is as flimsy as my first impression. Even the buttons to change the cup size are reversed compared to the SS-700, which makes it confusing if you're used to that one.

I own a number of them, and love them all.  But this one has a serious flaw, and I think it's worth noting.  I own a Cuisinart 14-cup coffeemaker, and it has worked flawlessly for a couple years now.  Love it. It's why I chose to buy this single-serve coffeemaker instead of one made by another manufacturer.  The problem: every time I brew a cup of coffee, the machine splatters water (or coffee) all over the countertop.  I've used my normal 12-ounce coffee mugs, and brewed an 8-ounce cup in the mug.  Water and coffee sprays everywhere.  The only way I can avoid this is by removing the drip tray and placing a tall travel mug under the brew head, and since that sits so close to the base of the brew head, nothing can splatter outside it.  Then I have to pour the coffee from the travel mug into my coffee mug.  Just doesn't seem to me that this machine should be touted as the answer to brewing single-cup servings in a mug resting on the drip tray, when what it really means is I have to clean up the granite countertop after every cup it brews.

The SS-15 does not hold as much water, so if you're a big K-Cup user, you might like the SS-10's bigger water reservoir over the small reservoir of the SS-15.

Worse yet, it splatters hot liquid all over the place as it's brewing. Dangerous and hard on the wardrobe.  Ridiculous!  I wound up returning the SS-10.  I was about to order the discontinued SS-770 instead, but came across a troubleshooting website.  Turns out the pump fix for my good old SS-770 was super easy.

Really liked that one, except it only lasted 3 years. The SS10 is not as large which is nice. But, it is also not as sturdy, just feels and looks cheaper. I don‚Äôt have good feelings about this one. Hope it surprises me. I did measure the water volume and it is not correct. It produces about one to two ounces more than it is supposed to. So the 8 ounce setting gives almost 10.  Not a deal killer but not accurate. Not bad if you want a larger cup. It also does not heat the water as hot. It only comes out at 170 degrees in the extra hot setting. This is too low for proper coffee brewing. The SS700 is 10 degrees hotter. Still not as hot as it should be but better nervetheless. I am at 8300 feet altitude so your results may be better. I do like that it does not need to be turned on a few minutes to preheat the water. It is more of an instant heater.  It takes longer to brew a cup because of the instant heater. Although this may result in a better brew as the water may stay in contact with the grounds longer.

We are heavy users and no matter the brand and regularity of does align, the pump fails and the unit must be replaced. Current coffeemaker pump is starting to go, so I went online to order a new one. I see that Cuisinart has replaced the SS 770 with the SS 10. The SS 10 has a smaller water reservoir, it is much lighter weight, the mechanisms are all clunky and cheap vs the fine, smooth operating mechanisms on the SS 770.  Already getting bad vibes. Ours arrived without the holder for the K-cup. We tried to see if the one from our SS 770 would fit but the design has changed and it does not fit. Additionally redesigned is the holder that allows you to brew a cup of coffee from your own grind. The SS 770 has a substantial holder with a screw on lid. I use it all the time. The SS 10 has a thinner, cheaper holder. Worse yet is the lid which instead of being screw on is attached by a small piece of plastic hinge that bends back and forth and snaps in place. This hinge will break in no time as the plastic is so thin. You don‚Äôt have to be an engineer to see that this is a terrible design. We used the holder that you fill yourself to make a cup of coffee. The SS 10 is much noisier to operate and takes longer to make a cup of coffee.

1891,Cuisinart,"January 7, 2018","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,1,"We purchased the Cuisinart SS-10 to replace a Cuisinart K-cup brewer which had failed after 8 years. The previous unit was a  Cuisinart SS-700 in silver, that is now only available in black (we prefer silver to match our kitchen). We generally liked the SS-700, so we decided to go with Cuisinart again, also because the 'look' is better than the competing Keurig units and we don't really care about Keurig 2.0 capabilities (coffee pods). Overall, our experience with the SS-10 has been disappointing: 1. The settings for cup size are very imprecise (see image), the 6 oz actually produces 7 oz and the 8 oz produces 9 oz. Since there's nothing in between you get your choice of coffee that's either too weak or too strong (or you can do what I do and set it to 8 oz setting, but pull the cup off the brewer when it actually reaches 8 oz and let the other 1 oz fall into the tray. You can get away with that exactly 3 times before your wife yells at you.) 2. The closure mechanism is different than the Keurig units and different than our prior Cuisinart SS-700 -- instead of pivoting the k-cup receptacle out and forward, which makes it convenient to remove, the SS-10 receptacle stays in place. It's just slightly less convenient to insert or remove a k-cup. 3. The other issue with the closure mechanism is that it feels like it requires move leverage and force to close the unit, this is because you are not 'scissoring' instead you are pushing down to pierce the k-cup. It makes you feel like you are breaking something. 4. Another issue is the feel of the cover -- it is held up by what feels like two rubber pieces rubbing together in a series of small bumps. While I cannot validate this, it feels very flimsy and feels like it will not last long. 5. Speaking of the cover (see image) it is also inconveniently implemented in 'chrome'. Not only does this detract from the matte silver design of the rest of the unit, it also shows finger prints and water marks easily. You need to clean the top every time you use the machine. 6. The 70 oz water capacity just seems small next to the 80 oz SS-700. I'm was not sure why it felt that way since it's really only about a cps difference, but then I realized that we were actually only capable of producing 9 oz coffees, so after 7 cups, it wants to be refilled! With the SS-700, and more precise cups, an 80 oz tank can do 10 cups (3 more). 7. This is just a 'nit' in comparison to the other issues, but the 'BREW' button is too small. Overall, had the unit been able to measure liquid, I might have been able to forgive the other faults, but given that it's mission is to deliver precisely measured, exactly heated cups of coffee, I could not live with it. It was returned in favor of a Keurig K575 (about $50 more than the SS-10). Pros: - One of the better looking silver K-cup brewers Cons: - Cannot produce a decent cup of coffee - Always needs cleaning - Small~ish water tank Recommendation: If you really like the 'look' and don't care about the coffee, it's a nice unit and very price-competetive. If you are looking for a good cup of coffee, look elsewhere.",Cannot produce a precisely measured cup of coffee,Amazon,2

In the middle of a descaling on a rainy day, the unit stopped working. It's dead Jim.  Taking it apart I discovered what I can only imagine was their idea of a safety device. A tampon balanced on a switch. When it expands due to moisture/wetness it pushes the switch inside and disconnects the power.  However, it will never contract! So you will either need to take it in for repair, or you toss it. (or you fix it like I did if you're handy)  A rather sad and cheap bit of built in obsolescence in the name of safety. Oh and you cannot find replacement parts for it online.  I tried to lookup the device to see what it was and could not no parts for the inside for do it yourself repairs. :( I still like the unit otherwise, but their choice of cheap safety kill device is pretty insane. Our previous Cuisinart unit blew up after about 2 years.  But we liked the added features so we went with another one. I often push 16 Oz out of my little SF Coffee pods using 12 oz and 4 oz settings. Which this makes nice and easy. Positives: It holds plenty of water. More so than a friends 2.0 Actual Keurig unit. It has a clock but the clock feature can be turned off.  (not another forced power failure reminder) It pumps a little slower than our old one, but that seems to help it get more flavor out of the coffee. It comes with a reusable pod.  The pod holds  a lot more coffee than generic ones but.. Negatives:  Their reusable coffee filter is more of a pain to take in and out compared to the generic ones.  Because the water tank is so thin it can be easy to spill water if you pore it in over having to remove it and refill it. ** A reminder to either not use or replace the little tank filters frequently and clean it every so often with vinegar .

1973,Cuisinart,"November 25, 2017","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,4,"This is our 5th K-cup machine.  First two where Keurig's, which had constant problems with clogging and short cupping.  Both died within weeks of the warranty expiring.  The next was the Cuisinart 700, which was fantastic for the first couple years.  Then it started to short cup, and required rebooting (un-plug) every couple days.  We followed that with an ICoffee Mozart, which was the most trouble free machine we've owned, until it started leaking internally a few days ago.  Since ICoffee is currently in limbo (new stock is months away), we looked into another Keurig, but gave up on that idea once we read reviews claiming that the machines clogged regularly, had control panel failures, and temperature problems.  By chance we came across the SS-10 on Amazon, and ordered one.  First thing we noticed, is that the SS-10 is much more compact then our old 700, which is a plus.  Another plus is that the machine heats up almost instantly.  No waiting a minute or more like we had to do with the Icoffee.  The menu and control panel are virtually identical to our old 700. We've brewed a dozen cups so far, from name brands and a small local roaster, and have not had the mess that some reviewers report.  We did take the advice from some of the other reviewers, and 'seat' the K-cup, piercing it with the bottom needle, before closing the lid.  After looking at the design, I think this step is a requirement.  Coffee is hot.  178 degrees in the finished cup on Xtra Hot, and 169 degrees on Hot. Now for a couple small inconveniences .  Due to the compact design, the clearance is only 6' with the drip tray installed, and 7-3/8' with the drip tray removed.  My wife's thermal mug, which she used everyday with the Icoffee, will not fit under this machine, even with the drip tray removed.  Our old 700 had 5 temperature settings where this machine only has 2.  Again, minor inconveniences.  The big question is, will this machine last longer then our previous 700?  Time will tell. UPDATE:  Only 1 week old, and started having problems with it bursting K-cups.  Traced the problem, not to the top punch that some blame, but a clogged bottom needle.  If the bottom needle clogs, pressure in the K-cup causes the top to burst open, leading one to believe the problem is in the top punch.  So, if this happens to you, clean the bottom needle.  Just run a straightened paper clip through the bottom needle, and it should start working fine again.  Had to drop my rating down to 4 stars due to the clogging.  I hope this will not be an ongoing issue.  In the year and a half I had the ICoffee, it never clogged once.","Fast, Compact Machine that makes Hot Coffee.",Amazon,3

1993,Cuisinart,"November 9, 2017","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,4,"We've been through two Keurig machines, each of which lasted a couple of months.  Our best luck was with an iCoffee machine, which lasted around 2 1/2 years.  It seems that even with the highly rated (reviewed) machines, there are a substantial number who have complaints.  So what are you going to do? We went with the Cuisinart SS-10.  This in spite of reviews about coffee grounds everywhere, a chintzy access door, not able to use a travel mug and coffee spraying everywhere. After using it for about a month, so far we are pleased.  I agree that the access door for pod placement does not have a good, solid feel to it and you wonder if it will eventually break.  Nevertheless, right now it works fine.  We have had no issues with the liquid spraying all over.  Maybe a little infinitesimal mist if you look closely.  We avoid any problem by simply moving the mug back a little from its most pushed-in position.  This is a habit we developed out of necessity with the iCoffee machine, which did indeed spray all over. I cannot understand the people who complain that it will not accept travel mugs.  As my pictures plainly show, it readily accepts what I consider to be a standard travel mug.  I then switched to a much taller Yeti-type mug.  While this does not fit with the little spill-collector thing in place, it is the simplest thing in the world to just lift it out while your oversized mug is filling.  Total additional time required:  About four seconds to remove and replace. Some have complained that the coffee is not hot enough.  The machine defaults to the 'extra hot' setting and I found this right at the limit of comfort.  Any hotter would have been a little too hot. As others have noted, this device has almost no delay between turning it on and getting the coffee running into your cup. One minor annoyance is that if you fill the reservoir right to the fill line, the machine will not function and will give the message 'add water.'  (that's not a typo).  You then have to turn the machine off, get rid of some water, maybe to about a half inch from the fill line, turn it on again and it will be happy. Until they make a perfect coffee maker with only 5-star reviews, this one seems to be a good choice.",No problems so far,Amazon,4

First thing and the major issue was the temperature of the water, 155 degrees F, not nearly hot enough.  I reached out to Cuisinart customer service and they couldn't even respond so I reached out to Amazon.  Amazon has always been fair and has great customer service, they sent a replacement right away.  To my dismay the replacement had the same temperature issue plus on occasion would leak water.  I've since returned both units and purchased another brand that is nearly half the amount.  I'm hopeful this new one will be much better.

This time 25 mins of hold to speak to another rep. She didn't have me try anything else after hearing the machine has never even pulled in water. I was told they have a limited warranty so I would have to pay shipping to send to them. They would check it out and maybe send the same one back to me if it wasn't covered. This for a machine that hasn't worked once that was delivered to me on the day before I called in. SERIOUSLY?

It was only a little over three years old. I asked if this model was still being made and they said it had been discontinued. The replacement they said was equal to the SS-700 is this one, the SS-10. So I ordered it and probably should have sent it back when it came out of the box. It is in no way equal to the older model. This one is very light weight. It's very cheaply made. All plastic. It's much smaller with a shorter cord. And I do not like the design. The K-cup opening at the top is no longer angled. It's horizontal and very hard to put the K-cup in and hard to remove it. The machine works but it feels like a cheap Keurig. The water reservoir is smaller. The plate that your cup sits on is smaller. It's cheaply made and I don't like it.

2073,Cuisinart,"September 16, 2017","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,2,"After finally retiring my old Breville BKC700XL (it stopped brewing), I looked long and hard for a replacement. The Cuisinart SS-10 came recommended from a number of sources, but I can't help but express significant reservations, if not outright disappointment with the noticeable difference in build quality between these two units. Let's start with the obvious: the Amazon listing for this product says 'Stainless Steel' right in the title. The model name is SS-10, and I'll presume that the SS is intended to suggest stainless steel. I'd invite anyone to examine this unit, and count the stainless steel components. I count two: the Cuisinart nameplate, and the grill on the drip tray. The rest of the unit is silver-colored plastic. By contrast, the Breville was wrapped in beautiful brushed stainless. The finish quality isn't terrible, but compared to the Breville BKC700XL, it feels like comparing a Bently to a Kia. Functionally, the pod unit on this brewer is... Well... It's terrible. The needles that puncture the cups (top and bottom) aren't sharp, so they kind of mash the cup up in the pod unit. I've only brewed a couple of cups so far, but you can immediately feel that the unit is struggling to properly seat and puncture the cup. The way the unit opens and closes lacks any feel of quality as well. The filtering system is a sham; a complete lie (photo attached). I'm not sure why they bothered with the filter mechanism, outside of being able to say 'it has a filter'. When installed, there is a huge gap (about 3 mm) for water to flow AROUND the filter. What is the point of a filter that simply sits in the tank? I feel insulted. More build quality gripes. I use a tall stainless vacuum tumbler to hold my 12 oz brew. In order to use my tumbler, I have to remove the drip tray. On the BKC700XL (yeah, I know, I sound like a broken record) the bare tray was a nice, solid piece of plastic, with well-finished surface and edges. That brewer sat on my counter for nearly 5 years without the drip tray, and my wife never noticed. With the tray removed from the Cuisinart, my wife immediately asked me, 'where's the missing part?' The bare tray is ugly, and not finished in a way that looks like it's intended for use this way. Does it brew a decent cup of coffee? Sure. So does a $70 Keurig-branded unit. I think Cuisinart are overselling the 'premium' aspect of this unit. It's a small step above lesser expensive models, and in some ways, a step down. When compared to previous 'premium' offerings from competitors like Breville, it's an absolute blow-out in favor of the Breville. I'm deeply disappointed that the BKC700XL was discontinued, and I'm disappointed that Cuisinart would put a premium label on this product.",Stainless Steel? Premium? That's quite the stretch.,Amazon,1

The SS-10 was very noisy, was very slow and did not heat up the water above 165-degrees. The coffee it make did not taste right, so I looked up on line what makes great coffee. One key factor is that the water should be between 195 and 205 degrees. I returned the product as defective since it could not heat the water to the required temperature. The SS-780 heats the water to 192 degrees which is much closer to the recommended temperature. You can order the SS-10 and hope it is better than the one I received.

Since the HB was $79, I decided to give it a try.  I should have known better.  Fake reviews, paid reviews, et.  I ALWAYS wind up going with the higher quality Cuisinart, and this was no exception.  The HB took a whopping THREE MINUTES for the first drop to even hit the cup!  That was a deal breaker for me.  My full size Cuisinart coffeemaker I've had since 2000 was quicker than that!  This beauty....took only EIGHT SECONDS!  And it is not only fast (complete cuppa joe from ice cold, refridgerated water in less than 58 SECONDS!) but it's also functional, and gorgeous to look at. It comes with (no separate purchase, and wondering if it will fit/work) a removable filter and holder that replaces the K-cup holder in the front.  It stores neatly hidden inside the right hand side of the machine (you push an indent and it pops open on the side, and stays out of sight the rest of the time...but more importantly, you can't misplace it!)  Since you can add your own coffee to it, you can continue to use your favorite bagged coffees, as well as add two scoops of ground coffee to make a 12 oz cuppa joe (or basically, 2 cups at the same time).  Perfect for when I'm getting ready to go to work and need that extra cup. It also has the great feature of a hot water button that's just as quick and allows you to make a cup of tea or cocoa, which I prefer doing as compared to buying the tea K-cups, which don't brew long enough.  Simply add the tea bag to the cup, lift the head up and down (make sure there's no empty k-cup or grounds in there) and push the button, and the tea will be steeped by the time you've got a cup full of hot water. Done in a flash, and done with class. Cuisinart has never let me down.  Quality you can see and feel.  I'm really pleased with this purchase.

2129,Cuisinart,"August 22, 2017","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,2,"Bought as a replacement for Cuisinart SS-7000 which worked well for 4 years until it finally was more effort to troubleshoot than buy a new one. Unfortunately they don't make the SS-7000 any more. Rather than deal with the unreliability of a Keurig machine (nor deal with the proprietary 2.0 cups) I decided to stay loyal to Cuisinart: the SS-7000 worked well for about 4 years. While I like the smaller form factor of the SS-10, it became immediately apparent after first use that it is a very cheaply made product. There are very obvious (and puzzling) signs of cost-cutting design decisions that negatively far outweigh any benefit of increasing profits, IMHO. Here are the top 3 head scratchers: 1. They removed the tiny LED light that illuminates the water tank. This makes it very difficult to see how much water is in the tank (esp if you keep your machine under cabinets without overhead lighting). Not sure how much money they saved on this decision, but it's a major loss. 2. The mechanism for opening/closing the coffee extractor is very awkward and feels like it will break/snap when lowering it down on a new kcup before brewing. This is partly due to the all plastic materials whereas the SS-7000's mechanism was much smoother and more weighted due to its metal construction. Feels very flimsy. 3. The water tank filter design is laughable. Whereas previous versions of the filter would attach to the tank directly over the water intake (therefore filtering all water before it gets taken in) the SS-10's filter is installed into a plastic guide that has the filter hovering about a half-inch above the water intake! It's basically like just throwing the charcoal filter loose into the water tank. I don't see how this design can actually filter water before it gets taken into the unit. So beware esp if you use tap water. I can't recommend this machine due to the reasons above. Sadly, I can't recommend an alternative either. Maybe it's time to reconsider the convenience of a kcup after all.",Poor/cheap replacement for the SS-7000,Amazon,2

I was trying to replace an SS-700, which had served us well for years. The SS-10 is clearly a cost-cutting redesign. Compared to the SS-700, the pump is noisier and slower, the cord is shorter (seriously, we would have needed an extension cord to hook up a device three feet from an outlet), the reservoir is smaller, and the opening mechanism to insert or remove a k-cup (you know, the thing you need to use every time you brew a cup of coffee) felt like all the moving parts were made of plastic--flimsy, stiff, and uneven. I have zero confidence that the hinge would stand up to more than a couple months of use Even after several years of use, and brew times getting slower, I feel that our old SS-700 has more life left in it than a brand-new SS-10. Giving an extra star, because perhaps the machine would seem OK to somebody who hasn't used the previous model, but it's a huge step down for anybody who has.",the thing you need to use every time you brew a cup of coffee) felt like all the moving parts were made of plastic--flimsy,Amazon,3

NOOoooooooo. This new design is terrible.  It splashes coffee all over the place.  Here are some photos of how it splashes to coffee onto the back of the unit and onto the kitchen counter after JUST ONE USE.  I could not imagine the mess after a week's worth of brewing.  This means constant cleaning.  In addition, the used K-Cup was dripping from the needle hole when I took it out to throw it away.  The previous model SS-700 used K-Cups did not drip, probably because it makes a smaller needle hole. The 10 oz brew tastes a bit watery from the SS-10. The lid mechanism on this new design feels a bit awkward since you first lift up on a spring loaded lever, which then pulls up the lid.  The K-Cup remains upright on this model.  The previous model SS-700 has a nice solid feeling loading mechanism that moves the holder so the K-Cup is at an angle facing you.  I like the older mechanism much better than this cheap feeling one. I like the blue LED on the previous model SS-700 that highlights the water remaining.  For some reason they removed the light on this updated model. Even the charcoal filter holder has a worse design on this new model.  The plastic cage holds the filter somewhat near the water intake, whereas the previous model SS-700 the filter placement is more precise relative to the water intake. This one also has a slightly smaller water reservoir, and an overall cheaper feel.  There are no improvements to the LCD display or programming options. I guess that this new model SS-10 is the result of financial engineering by Cuisinart managers looking to shave costs anywhere they can.  This is a missed opportunity that will hurt Cuisinart.

Gone are the blue LED lights in the water resivuoir, too bad as it was a nice indicator the unit was 'on' and the blue cast a subtle light at night that was pleasing to the eye. Water temp. is selectable by HOT & XHOT instead of by degrees ex. 192*. But XHOT is much HOTTER than the 192* setting on the SS700 and that is a plus. Head functionality is only a possible improvement. On the SS700 both the upper and lower 'jaws' of the head moved which created a problem later in the units life, via misalignment, either crushing through the top of the K-cup or creating an elongated hole. This is simplified in this unit, only the top moves, and I hope it eliminates the crushing. However, the 1st K-cup through the machine had it's top seal blown off and coffee grounds went everywhere. A second K-cup experienced no problems. The Problem may have been the 1st K-cup itself or the fact the the cradle for the K-cup allows for the K-cup to wobble. Time will tell. If the exploding seals continue the unit will be returned to Amazon. 3 stars for now. 9/8/2017 update: Machine has performed flawlessly since the initial review.

After owning Cuisinart's predecessor model SS-700, which malfunctioned after 3 years, I went ahead and purchased the SS-10 thinking they had worked through the de-scaling problems of the previous model.  I was SO wrong!  I've had this one for less than one week. The 'Low Water' indicator came on & I refilled the reservoir, which on any other coffee maker would have taken care of the issue.  The problem with this coffee maker is that when the unit turns on with too little water and the indicator light comes on, you must unplug the unit for ONE HOUR until it will be ready to brew again!  This is according to Cuisinart Customer Service.  They do not even acknowledge this to be a design flaw!  I explained, what if you are leaving for work or a meeting, you probably don't have an hour to wait around for your coffee maker to regroup.  No matter, I did as instructed.

I always had luck with the Cuisinart brand. It holds about 40 ounces of water so you do not have to refill often. It is a little cheaply made.

This is the 3rd premium Keurig machine I've had in 10 years. They last on average, 5 years before the pump goes out. The first one was made by Breville, the second by Cuisinart. They both worked perfectly until the pumps died. This new version of the Cuisinart Keurig is astonishingly bad. It looks and feels like cheap plastic, like it should be sold at the Dollar Store. The tank is difficult to take on and off and gets stuck when putting it back on, then you have to pry it loose and doing so feels like you're going to break something. The top opens up stiffly and jerks open, same when trying to close it, you have to press hard to get it closed so it just seems like it will break each time. Set it up with the difficulty mentioned above, and ran 12 oz of hot water through it. The sound it makes is alarming, sounds like it struggles to pump and it whines like an old steam boiler. The previous models never sounded like this.  The 12 oz of water took three times longer to dispense than the old models, even with their pumps failing. It sputtered and dripped a lot. The second two rounds of 12 oz of water tests were the same.  Then I tried a k-cup. It was the slowest brewed cup of coffee ever. A tiny single stream took forever to dispense on the 10 oz setting. This thing is going back immediately. Keurig and Cuisinart - If you are reading these reviews, pay attention! Your quality has seriously degraded.

2166,Cuisinart,"July 23, 2017","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,1,"I had high hopes for this Cuisinart product, however as most Cuisinart products we have purchased lately, it has failed to live up to its name. We purchased this product to replace its predecessor, the SS-700, we had for 4 years. The SS-700 brewed a single cup of coffee very quickly, but after 4 years the heating element did itself in. Cuisinart, undoubtedly, realized the problem with the SS-700, thus the SS-10 was born. While the concept seemed to work great at first, it seems that these units are made with cheaper, more faulty components, as well. We purchased the SS-10 in the beginning of October 2016. By the beginning of May 2017, it had started showing signs of faulty workmanship in the components. Now, I have followed the regular maintenance of the descaling cycle using white distilled vinegar, but that apparently wasn't enough to keep this product alive. By  early May, it started showing signs of decline as it would take a very long time to brew a cup of coffee. It seemed that the length of time kept growing over the next month, even after running seven descale processes through it in a four week period. Finally, I had to breakdown and call Cuisinart when I got the dreaded 'EEO' code. Their initial response was 'to unplug the unit for at least an hour and a half to reset the unit,' which we did. Immediately, the unit displayed 'EEO' again on the next attempted brew. So, again with the phone call to customer service. This time they issued me a service number, a call tag for the faulty unit and said a new unit would be shipped to me. Hurray, I thought. Only, after two and a half weeks  went by with no new coffee maker on my front porch, I began to wonder what was happening. I called again, only to find out that the units were on back-order. They could not tell me when they would ship again, and that it could take another 3-4 weeks. Oh well, I thought. Then to my surprise, a week and a half later the new unit was sitting on my doorstep! It was a Friday gift! What a way to go into the weekend! The next morning, I got up and set up the unit, following the set up instructions provided in the box. Only this time, when getting to step 6 (the part about brewing 8 oz of water to flush the system) nothing happened. No pump running sound. Not a drop of water moving. Then the error code 'EEO.' I thought, maybe the reservoir isn't seated correctly. So, I lifted it, and set it down and watched to make sure the gasket actually lifted from the pass thru channel, and tried again. Still nothing, just 'EEO.' I turned it off, back on, tried again. Still nothing. I unplugged it, waited for a couple of hours, tried again and nothing. 'EEO.' So, I called customer service again. They said that I would have to try to brew a cup several times before it might start working. I informed them that I had tried at least 7 or 8 times, and still nothing except the error code. So, they said they would ship me a new unit. However, they were on back-order again! So, I politely asked if I could just get a refund. The lady, as helpful as she could be, said that Cuisinart's policy is that they do not issue refunds. I asked, what would happen if the next unit was also faulty? How many times do we have to do this with a clearly, defective appliance? She informed me that after 3 or more attempts to replace the unit, we could issue a LETTER requesting a CREDIT from Cuisinart, which we can use to buy another Cuisinart product. As a consumer, I find this to be not helpful. If I do not want their product anymore, I must resign myself to the fact that they got my money, and I got a piece of junk in return. They win, I lose. I know this, after this experience and my last experience with a Cuisinart blender (don't get me started on that), I will NEVER buy a Cuisinart product again. I urge anyone reading this to second guess themselves before purchasing a Cuisinart product, as well. They used to be one of the greats. Now, they are just out to sell an inferior product over and over to claim as much of the market share they can get their hands on. What ever happened to quality products? What ever happened to quality workmanship? Sorry, Cuisinart, but you've joined the ranks of the marginally mediocre. Good work! I hope you're proud of your achievements. You've made it to the bottom with the rest of the world of product producers.",Cuisinart strikes again!,Amazon,7

Why buy an espresso machine when this will do it? Take a dark roast coffee, Italian, French or any other and brew on 4 ounce setting. Whoa! Close enough to true espresso without the special grinding, packing the brew unit and clean up.

We have always owned Keurigs. I was very upset that their recent model forced me to limit my k-cup choices to their offerings or essentially re-rig the machine on my own to take others. My husband and I decided to get a Cuisinart. We waited 3 days to get this via Amazon. That's 3 days with no morning coffee..... perhaps I'm a bit grumpy right now. We got the Cuisinart this morning and I was so excited. My husband got it set up and we keep getting the EE0 error message. We talked to Cuisinart customer service and they gave us a couple pointers and then told us to send it back. Needles to say I'm very frustrated and will be reconsidering my Cuisinart purchase. The machine is very nice looking but c'mon .... how many more mornings with no coffee!? And the hassle of sending a coffee pot back is not ideal.

Some of the features are nice but there is no 'bold' option which would run the water through slower, saturating the grounds, more effectively and make a stronger cup. The only way I can get a halfway decent cup of coffee is to use espresso roast and the 4 oz setting which is their solution to that problem. So, needless to say my morning to-go cup of coffee requires 4 k cups and it is still on the weaker side for my preferences, especially for an espresso roast. Auto-brew setting is pretty much useless since it only does one cup at a time - nice thought but really only a worthy feature if you actually only make a single cup or use a carafe (a feature this machine does not offer).  I will likely just go back to a regular coffee pot where I can set it and not have to worry about it until I am ready to pour. One really annoying design flaw I would like to point out is that the drip tray, while it does come out, it is not attached to the brewer but sets into another smaller tray which is attached and cannot be removed. This limits the use of travel mugs. My 20 oz Yeti knock off barely fits under it and I have to set it in at an angle and then turn it upright because of that second tray. If you are going to make a tray removable, make it removable entirely. If it was truly removable, I could set the mug under it without having to maneuver it at all.","Don't buy if you like strong coffee, especially if it's in a travel mug",Amazon,3

It must be some sort of safety feature or insurance thing that won't allow them to have it go over 180 degrees, despite what you set it to on the machine itself.  I primarily use the filter basket and holder to brew my own coffee rather than K-Cups.  Moreover, with the coffee that I use...a fine grind...I get good results in body and flavor.  I am pleased with the look of the machine, and it is also pretty quiet.  The start-up hum is moderate and then quickly settles down during the brewing process.

I had one of the original Keurig machines and while it did it's job for the better part of 4 years, there were a couple of operational niggles that I lived with the whole time I owned it. Coffee is supposed to be served hot and my Keurig was never quite hot enough there wasn't any recourse to correct the issue.  It was also slow, loud and serving sizes were inconsistent.  I know this looks like three more items, but in actuality all stemmed from the same inadequate pump system. When its pump finally quit and put itself out of my misery, I began to research a replacement maker. I began to read about Keurig's controversial pod policy and decided I wanted to find an alternative company to purchase from.  In all honesty, there really aren't that many companies that successfully make a competitive machine. The one that I do have substantial experience with (largely positive) was Cuisinart and that's where I focused my research ... It was a good decision.

(amazing, right?!). 6th is price: cheaper than Bed Bath and Beyond, even with their 20% off coupon. THIS time I bought the four year extended warranty because, well, ya never know.

The warm up time for the Cuisinart to begin brewing is extremely short.  In fact I can turn it on and immediately insert the pod and begin the brew cycle.  The actual brewing does take longer than the Krups as the water flow rate is slower, but that might account for the better taste as the slower flow extracts more of the flavor from the grounds.

The Keurig ones we had issues with 'contents being under pressure' and grounds getting in our cup more times than not and those stupid cups get to be costly when it takes 3 to 7 misfired ones before being able to brew a cup of coffee.  I clean my machine frequently so it wasn't an issue that was brought on due to negligence just something I think they did when they decided to change the cups as well- offer a junkier product that won't last so that you have to keep replacing it.  I read that this machine has the same issues later on (read a paper clip will fix it right up on this model- didn't work on  my Kuerig)  we shall see, but one thing I will tell you is that the water temp is much hotter than Keurig ever was able to pull off.

I read the reviews, I watched the videos comparing it to the Keurig and to the older model Cuisinart, my expectations were really high. The main thing keeping me from loving it is that it's slightly slower than my old Keurig. Here are the things that I really, really like about it: - The water is noticeably hotter than my old Keurig, so the coffee tastes better, stronger. - It looks much sleeker and takes up a bit less room on my counter. The reservoir isn't lit, so it's more low-key. - It holds a bit more water in the reservoir and it doesn't need to be filled as quickly. - It's ready to brew the instant you turn it on. Here are the things that keep me from loving it: - It's slower than my old Keurig Platinum...not much slower, but it is slower. - It doesn't really need a hot water button, since it does the same thing as the brew button...you still need to remove the pod. - The handle to open the head feels flimsy, I worry that it'll break quickly.

2345,Cuisinart,"March 16, 2017","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,4,"I purchased this to replace the employee coffee station at work, and we have gotten a serious amount of use out of this thing! We have had it for a few months and it gets pretty heavy daily use; about 12 cups of coffee a day and a sporadic cup of tea. The machine was shipped promptly and was well packaged with no damage. It does take about 5-10 minutes to assemble a few parts and get it up and running. The little carbon water filter  has some prep before you make the first cup of coffee, and you need to replace the filter about every month. I had no problems finding a bulk pack of the filters on Amazon. Our office does not use the k-cup pods, only the brew pod for ground coffee. It takes about 1full minute to brew the cup of coffee so it will seem like forever compared to a Keurig if you stand there and watch it. However, it has been a nice outlet for employees to take a quick and needed break during the day. Pros: -The display is very simple and easy to use when it comes to choosing size, temperature, and beverage. Employees were concerned at first the the process would be too complicated, but after 2-3 tries it's very self-explanatory. -I like that the machine has a timer on it. We have the default option set so that the machine turns off after 30 minutes being idle. -As stated above, the length of time it takes to make is a pro for us since it allows us to take a break, but this may be perceived as a con to some. -We love the option to also dispense just hot water for tea. I recommend doing a rinse cycle before, but have never had issues with the water being coffee- contaminated. - The option to do ground coffee or k-cups is pretty cool even though we don't use the k-cups. It comes with a k-cup pod holder that you swap out. I had a hard time finding a high rated coffee maker that would only do one serving rather than the pot, so this was a great find. - We are still using up coffee supplies from our previous machine, which was a behemoth gas station-like 'gourmet cappucino' contraption that was supplied with mediocre ground coffee. Surprisingly the cheap ground coffee is much tastier in this new machine. Cons: -The actual brew is a little weak, even when you fill the coffee pod all the way to the max line, but that may be personal preference since I drink my coffee black. The coffee color comes out looking more like milk chocolate color rather than a dark chocolate shade. However, as my comment above states, we are using mediocre quality coffee, so the brew strength may significantly improve with decent coffee or a slightly finer grind. I will update my review when we get nicer coffee! -It's a pain how often you have to refill the water vessel. We have about 6 people using the machine throughout the day and the vessel get maybe 5 cups of coffee before it's empty. If it's just a home coffee maker this won't be a big deal, but try to keep the machine near a sink to make the refills quick and easy. - The space where the coffee pods is held gets dirty fast. Again, this machine gets a lot of users who are not always careful when adding coffee. However, the square container on top of the machine is hollow. So the coffee pod only takes up a small section of the space, leaving pockets where loose coffee falls in. I stuff a paper towel in the space to clean it up. Again, a home user probably won't have much of an issue with this but definitely check in there occasionally and clean it out. Overall it's a purchase everyone in the office is satisfied with.",Dependable coffee machine for a small office,Amazon,4

Second, and pretty important in my opinion, is that it appears to pump itself dry at the end of the cycle.

(The other k brand often breaks soon after the 1 year warranty expires, which is part of the reason I chose Cuisinart.) It came with a reusable cup (that stores right in the machine) so I can use my own freshly ground blends. It also came with charcoal filters, but I already use fltered water so I set it aside. The tank is a large 72oz, and is easy to remove to clean or to refill from my refrig-filtered water dispenser. The kcup holder also removes easily to rinse and is dishwasher-safe - I'm a clean freak, so this is perfect for me. It has a rinse feature that puts about 4oz of water through so you can make iced tea that doesn't taste like coffee. It also dispenses hot water only. It has two water temp selections, hot and xhot, I just love this choice! It has 5 cup size selections:4, 6, 8, 10, 12oz. The machine displays a message when you need to add water. It has an auto on/off timer which is nice to save power use, but I dont use the auto on timer because you can just hit the power switch and press brew and it immediately starts. The default auto off timer is 30 minutes, which works for me, but you can set it longer, or you can have it always on. The are only two slight negatives:1) the pump is a little noisier than I expected, but it doesn't bother me. 2) If you use a short mug, like 8oz, it splatters everywhere and you have to wipe down the machine and the counter, so I just use a taller cup.

This single serve coffee maker met all of my personal criteria: 1) brews K-cups 2) includes a reusable filter so that I can pick/choose my own ground coffee beans 3) has a clock with an auto On Time setting 4) relatively good reviews from customers.  It looks similar to the Cuisinart SS-700, which got good reviews and seems similar to the one recommended by America's Test Kitchen.  The only complaints from previous SS-700 customers were the components (seems more 'plastic' than the SS-700) and the noise (louder than original). 5) as a bonus, the Cuisinart SS-10 has a 3 year warranty, so at least there is some coverage for breaks/technical difficulties. MY EXPERIENCE: During my first week, the Cuisinart SS-10 brewed as expected from both the K-cups and reusable filter.  I think I have finally found what formula works for my tastes (2 tbsp medium ground coffee brewed hot into 6 oz fluid).  The settings are pretty user friendly.  This model brews coffee pretty quickly (I'd estimate about 2 minutes) and the noise is minimal for me (doesn't awaken my husband and toddler). MINUS 1-STAR:  I removed 1 star from this product because of the On Time function.  Based on the reviews, I expected the On Time function to automatically turn on the coffeemaker at a certain time AND brew the coffee/hot water.  (I was hoping for this function to cut down on time in the mornings as I get coffee ready before work.)  After a few tries, I realized that the On Time function only turned the coffeemaker on WITHOUT brewing the coffee.  I contacted Cuisinart customer service to clarify this function and the rep confirmed that it SHOULD turn on at a certain time and brew coffee as I expected.  I contacted the seller (on Amazon) re: this function and received a replacement coffeemaker in the mail today.  I programmed the coffeemaker On Time function on the new coffeemaker as a test.  Again, the new coffeemaker turned on automatically, but did NOT brew coffee at the programmed time.  So, I contacted Cuisinart customer service again to clarify whether I received a second defective coffeemaker.  This time, the Cuisinart customer service rep confirmed that this model's On Time function only turns on the coffeemaker, but does NOT brew the coffee at a programmed time.  Other Cuisinart coffeemakers do brew at a certain time, just not this one.  I advised her to update their seller information, as this is misleading. Other than the above, the coffeemaker has worked well.  I will keep the original coffeemaker and return the new one to the seller.  Though I would have liked to program my coffee to brew at a certain time, it brews quickly enough for me to just turn it on myself.",Good Single Serve Coffeemaker; Auto On Time Function Only Turns On Coffeemaker (Does Not Brew Automatically),Amazon,11

In other words, if you click the right button, the settings go to the left -- backwards! The old version (two of which died over time) had the buttons in the opposite order.

2446,Cuisinart,"October 10, 2016","Cuisinart SS-10 Premium Single-Serve Coffeemaker, Silver",B014W1C2VM,3,"I've answered a couple of questions above, and in one I mention the fact that I've owned K-cup brewers for years and years (probably going on 10+). I started with Keurig, but for nearly every brewer I purchased they would die shortly after their warranty expired. Then other manufactures started producing K-cup brewers, and after considerable research (and cost) I picked up my first Cuisinart brewer (SS700 type). The first unit died after 1.5 years, and I took advantage of the 3 YEAR WARRANTY to get a replacement (no service issues at all). The replacement lasted another 2 years and it was time to purchase another SS700. My current unit lasted the entire warranty period and then some. Now it's time to replace my current unit and I struggled tremendously with the choice between the newer SS10 and the 'Good Ole' SS700. I finally decided to go with the SS10 due to my concerns of the SS700 being phased out and not being able to get a replacement under warranty. Honestly, I wish I had gone with the SS700 and taken my chances with the warranty. The SS10 is, as others have stated, completely plastic and cheaply made. Not what I'm used to from Cuisinart whose products always cost more, but what you got was a very solid product. The unit is slightly shorter than the SS700 which means I have to pull the bottom plate to fit in my travel mugs (fit under the SS700). When I first ran the rinse cycle during prep, hot water ran down behind the filter assembly and had to be wiped up with a paper towel. The water tank is smaller and IS NOT illuminated in any way. In fact, on the SS700 the tank was lit and when it was out of water flashed on and off to let you know. On this unit, if you're in a hurry you could easily push the brew button, walk away and come back to... nothing (can you tell, already been there). Finally, call this nit-picky, but it is so aggravating!!! The cup size buttons are backwards! They have been placed in a totally counter-intuitive (and counter-SS700) manner. There are two buttons for increasing cup size... one left and one right. The digital display shows larger cup sizes to the right. To select a larger cup size you push... The LEFT button while the display moves to the Right (and vice-versa for smaller)! Really? The machine is also slower to make a cup of coffee than my SS700s were. So from a quality perspective, comparing this to its predecessor - not good. However, it does make a good tasting cup of coffee. So for me it's like going from a Cadillac to Chevy. The Chevy will get you where you need to go, just without the bling factor. And on that note... I should point out that the SS10 cost a lot less than the SS700 and it's reflected in the quality of the product. Good cup of coffee, but I personally would not call the SS10 the replacement model for the SS700. Hope Cuisinart reconsiders...",The SS10 -vs- the SS700,Amazon,36

So I based my selection of the SS-10 solely on aesthetics. In that regard I am not disappointed. It is a nice looking machine. After just 3 months of use though I discovered a design flaw. The puncturing device does not always punch all the way through the pod top covering. What happens is the device presses down but can't break through but the downward pressure causes the top to separate from the pod rim. The result is water and coffee grinds spewing out into the inside of the machine. I thought this might just be a problem with the Tim Horton brand of pods but I had the same problem with another brand. My work around is to pre-punch the hole. The hole I punch isn't as large as the hole the machine makes but even the smaller hole seems to enough to allow the machine to punch the larger hole.,Design flaw,Amazon,54

After trying to go the traditional coffee pot route for a while, I decided to give another single cup brewer a try. I really like the SS-10, more than the 700, for a couple of reasons:   ‚Ä¢It's a little smaller than the 700 so I don't have to pull it out from under the cabinets to open the lid or fill the water reservoir.   ‚Ä¢Literally no wait time from turning unit on to brewing a cup   ‚Ä¢For some reason, the coffee produced from the use-your-own brew basket is so much stronger and more flavorful than the 700.

All those reporting that it is noisy, I can't imagine we are reviewing the same machine, unless theirs are defective. It is WAY quieter than the 700 was.

Of course, I can see with my own eyes that the water level is low, but the light was pretty...   ‚Ä¢Ok so I'll admit this is very nitpicky, but it is a review so here goes: The cup sizes are shown smallest to largest from left to right. But when you want to go from default (8oz) to a smaller size, you hit the 'down' button which you would think should be placed to the left of the 'up' button, but is inexplicably placed to the right.

Uncomfortable mechanics - the mechanism to puncture and lock in the kcup is difficult to use, requiring more pressure than any other model I've used, to the point where you feel like you are going to break the plastic lever when you shut or hurt your hand.

The majority of the reviews were good, so I took a chance-wrong decision.  First indication that this was not going to be good came when my husband opened the box.  The machine was not 'factory packed'-placed in a bag but not sealed in any way, cord not tied up, etc.  Second indication was when we open the head-dried water spots on the backside of the head.  We did indeed order a 'new' product, not used, but that doesn't seem to be what we received.  We decided to try the machine anyway and it made a horrible grinding noise each time we tried to run a hot water or rinse cycle then the EEO noticed flashed on the screen which means to call customer service.  The grinding noise eventually stopped but the water stream was very weak and sputtered (same thing my SS-700 did just before it died).  Quality of this machine is a lot less also compared to the 700.  Top needle is plastic instead of metal, material of the machine is a very light weight and cheap plastic.

Pros: It dispenses one cup at a time, without having to make a 'pot' of it, it heats up well (and you can adjust temp), it will dispense just water for tea, instant drinks, etc., and you are not married to K-cups. You can use your own brand coffee in the alternative cup/basket offered in stores. Cons are: Noisier than my last SS-700, slower dispensing than the SS-700, and it splashes everywhere. I can live with the smaller reservoir, but they certainly didn't make any improvements on it's dispensing mechanism, but rather took a step backwards in that department. It also does not have a lit reservoir like the SS-700, which flashed when the water level got too low. Why they decided to do away with that feature,.... I don't know!

Subsequently, I was asked to reply with a bunch of things: 'Last Name, Shipping Address, Telephone Number, Model Number (located on the back or bottom of your unit, listed as model or cat number), Date Code (3 to 5 digits engraved into the metal prong of the power cord), Date of Purchase, Place of Purchase, Amount of Purchase, Proof of Purchase'. Once I provided, all that information (and after a reminder email), I heard back in 11 days with these preposterous instructions: '* Unplug the unit from the wall outlet and cut the line cord using a pair of scissors. (We would require the plug with about 2-3 inches of cord attached). * Package the cord along with a note/letter containing your name, address and transaction number (indicated below). * Include a $7.50 check or money order made payable to a Spectrum Brands to cover the Shipping and Handling of your replacement unit. Upon our receipt of these requirements the replacement unit will be shipped to you.' Really? For a $15-$20 faulty unit replacement, I have to jump all those hoops (cut the chord to a specified length, write a letter, prepare a check/money order, mail these all to Ohio). Seems like their support is still a few decades behind. Done with the brand. I recommend staying away if you expect to get any service on your purchase. ------------------------------ I use it once a week (Sundays) when I am home without access to free office coffee, and it worked well for the first few uses.

However, it makes very weak coffee because the water passes through the brewing cup too quickly, even when I use two paper filters. I end up having to add too much coffee to get a decent brew, even though I don't require particularly strong coffee. Therefore, what you save by buying this inexpensive little coffeemaker, you will quickly spend on twice as many filters and almost twice as much coffee. I also bought the Medelco 4-cup permanent basket coffee filter to use with this B&D and, while it did fit just fine, it too allowed the water to pass through the grounds too quickly even when supplemented with a paper filter. I bought this as a down-size replacement for my old 12-cup Proctor Silex (comparable current models 48521 or 48524), which I had given to my elderly father because of its simple on-off switch (hard to find a simple coffeemaker for an Alzheimer's sufferer!). Speaking of the simple on-off switch, that's an important feature for me, and the on-off switch on this B&D requires two hands, one to hold the coffeemaker in place, the other to flip the switch, which I find inconvenient. So, after using this B&D for a few months, I've ordered myself a new Proctor Silex 48524, and am hoping there haven't been any unfortunate changes made to that line since I bought my previous one.","Weak Coffee, Two-Handed On-Off Switch",Amazon,0

It takes up less space than the 12-cup, brews decent coffee and was inexpensive. We looked at a few similar models and this one stood out to us design-wise. Note: We had a previous coffee maker burn-out on us while not in use, just being plugged in and turned off, so that is why we always keep our coffee maker unplugged when not in use. (By 'burn-out' I mean, some wires were smoldering and the house smelled like burnt wires, and we found out this is not so uncommon.) I'm just sharing this to those who may care.

3480,Black & Decker,"July 6, 2017","BLACK+DECKER 5-Cup Coffeemaker, Black, DCM600B",B001NXC5YC,5,"UPDATED!  I wrote the review below after being disappointed in what I thought was a design flaw in the coffee maker that made it difficult to get the carafe in and out. It turned out to be a defective carafe lid that was causing the problem.  We replaced the new carafe with the carafe from the old machine,( old carafe was an identical model), and it now slides in and out easily. The plastic lid on the new carafe was slightly warped.. Everything works well now. This simple to use machine doesn't have any frills, but sometimes a bare bones machine is better than one with options. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I chose this coffee maker because my elderly mother has dementia. She is still well enough to make a pot of coffee, as long as there isn't a digital panel or more than one button. We were already using a nearly identical coffee maker from Black and Decker, but chose this 'upgrade' due to the front facing power button. Unfortunately, this model has a design flaw which will prevent us from using it. The carafe slides into place easily, but removing it takes two hands. One to hold the coffee maker, while the other pulls out the carafe. The coffee dispensing compartment is too far down and it grabs the carafe when we pull it out. This coffee maker was to replace a nearly identical Black and Decker model that we bought last year. The other model is also 5 cups, but has the power button on the side instead of the front. Also, the water container is shaped slightly different and the coffee compartment is pure plastic and apparently not the same size. In that model, the carafe slides in and out effortlessly. Mom and I are roommates, so I can watch to make sure she operates it correctly. The simple style gives her confidence and doesn't confuse her. We hoped this model would be better simply because of the front facing power button. Unfortunately, we can't risk Mom pulling the whole thing off the counter while trying to remove the carafe.","UPDATED REVIEW - Problem solved.

I needed something smaller to save space and my friends do not drink coffee. Within the first week of making coffee, the machine stopped getting water to the filter. Upon further inspection, the 'arm' that the water needs to flow through comes apart very easily. Hot water was spurting out all over the place and leaking back down to the reservoir, making the water hotter and hotter until the thing just started steaming. After it cooled down, I noticed that the part can be 'snapped' back together. It looks to me that the locking mechanism is not strong enough, it's just two pieces of plastic that come apart after repeatedly being heated. A great design for a coffeemaker that is obviously going to have hot water. Way to go Black & Decker Research and Development. If you've got one, try to clip the the pieces together tightly. We'll see how many days it holds. UPDATE: the part I snapped back fell completely apart so this is going to be returned. 0 stars.",Very cheaply made,Amazon,4

This coffee pot rocks for the price and is great for a minimal pot that doesn't take up much space.

I had a mr coffee brand one just like this that was much nicer and cost 3x as much.  The coffee never came out hot enough and I had to wait for the hot plate to warm up the coffee (or zap it in the micro).  I replaced my $30 pot with this $10 black and decker one and although it doesn't look quite as elegant, it does a much better job.  I highly recommend this for a cheapo pot. I use it with regular sized filters (bought a pack of 700 rockline filters on here with the pot for cheap, they fit great and work well so I recommend them together). Another reason I didn't like my mr coffee was the regular filters fit, but were a bit more cramped and I had to manipulate them a lot, while in this pot they fit perfectly.

My 4 year old 'Mr Coffee' died last month, on a day when I had a sinus infection...and, was jonesing for a hit of hot caffeine. Amazon had this appliance available for same-day delivery. That perk, combined with decent ratings and super-low price convinced me to give it a flier...and, it's been a solid case of 'good-for-the-money'. Let me elaborate: 1) The coffeemaker has zero ability to truly 'brew' your coffee. The grounds cup is wide open at the bottom, without the usual flange to slow the flow of hot water, and get maximum flavor out of your coffee beans. UPSIDE: super-fast brewing cycle DOWNSIDE: Even using premium coffee (Lavazza) and adding extra grounds results in 'wimpy' coffee 2) The coffeemaker does not brew at high temperature. Even when I pour immediately after brewing, I still have to put it into the microwave for 25 seconds, just to get it to the same temp that my Mr. Coffee brewed at. The lower temperature is another reason why it brews 'wimpy' coffee On the one hand, it brews coffee: simply, quickly and reliably...and, at a really low price-point. On the other hand, it doesn't truly 'brew' the coffee. The machine throws (reasonably) hot water over the grounds, which flow down into the pot too quickly to extract meaningful flavor from the beans. If you are indifferent as to your coffee...and, just want it 'quick & dirty'...you'll probably luv this machine.

Tried another two pots of usually wonderful Brazilian coffee (Jacques Vabre Notes de Bahia) and my not so fussy coffee drinking darling could still taste the plastic. Maybe you will be lucky and the plastic they use in your coffee maker will have been of better quality (I suspect that it's a lack of quality control that makes the hit or miss plastic or not problem).

This is especially frustrating if you are using high quality coffee, so I stick to the cheap stuff with this thing. The plastic looks and feels chintzy.

As I said in the title perfect for small spaces or the college student that needs a coffee maker but can't afford a crazy expensive one Pros: -Small and compact. However for the size the coffee maker makes a good amount of coffee. I use it only for myself, and it makes plenty for one person. -Easy to use, a monkey could do it. And it has a removable lining so to dump the coffee filters out or to clean. -Makes coffee very fast, less than 5 minutes because I usually only make 2-3 cups for myself. - price is unbeatable Cons: -Does not have a clock on it or any pre-set timer Very hard to come up with the cons for this review because it is so simple and easy to use. Recommmend to anyone that wants a simple coffee maker.

Only the old old kinds we can't get any more were better.  Use it at least once every day for a long time, longer than other makes and it has not yet failed to make very good coffee.  Plus it is easier to use than other makes were, such as pouring in the water, pouring out the coffee, turning on and off.  Less mess around below, but there is some due to my not waiting for it to finish dripping.  Coffee levels are easy enough to see and judge whether it is done dipping.  It does not shut off on its own, but the base stays hot enough to keep unused coffee hot for an hour or more.  I've never made a full pot of 5 cups, usually it's 2 cups, for which the small size filters are good enough.  Somewhat easier to clean, too, smaller hands would be preferred over large ones like mine.  But other coffee makers are often a tighter fit.

4380,Black & Decker,"September 25, 2016","BLACK+DECKER 5-Cup Coffeemaker, Black, DCM600B",B001NXC5YC,5,"I bought this on a whim...I'm a tea drinker as of late. It's starting to get cold at night and I wanted something to keep my already made tea hot. I tried the little mug warmers they sell that you plug in, but they don't keep my drink as hot as I would like it. I love my Hot Shot water boiler but it only made the hot water, and does not keep my tea hot. I looked, and looked, and thought and brain-stormed.  Ta-da...THIS! I can run hot water through the machine, into the carafe, and have hot water all day/night until I turn it off. I can make my tea (or instant oatmeal, instant hot chocolate, 3 in 1 coffee packets, from this hot water.  OR.... I can use my own glass teapot infuser on the bottom, let the hot water pour into the infuser through the tea/tisane I have in the filter and make my tea and keep it piping hot as I drink it. (I use one like this that I bought on e-bay:¬† Heat-resistant Borosilicate Glass Teapot 600ml with Infuser Microwave & Dishwasher safe! (Glass teapot 600ml, clear) ¬†)  OR... I can heat the water into the B&D carafe, pour it into a teapot to infuse, then pour it back into the B&D carafe to keep it hot (if the infuser doesn't fit the machine). I LOVE that the switch (on/off) is on the right side and also the water fill gauge on the right as I'm disabled (severe RA in most joints)  and in bed a lot so this sits right on my lower nightstand (make-shift) tea bar. When I wake up in the morning I have my hot tea before getting out of bed. I can see that the coffee maker is on by the glowing red light on the switch so I can turn it off when done. I don't have to call out for someone to make me a hot drink (bothering them) and I feel good about being able to do this myself (feeling of accomplishment). I can also make my evening tisanes/herbals the same way without any help. I keep 3 - 24 ounce bottles of water with me so I can drink to my heart's content all day and evening without getting up. The teas and tisanes keep me from munching out of boredom so this in-turn is healthy for me. Some teas I add a touch of sugar (kept in a small mason jar with lid) and a Mini-Moo (half and half) for richness (especially on the masala chai) but mainly I drink them plain. No matter how I'm drinking it, this machine keeps the tea nice and hot. I mainly use the B&D carafe for keeping hot water so in the morning I can make a miso soup, then instant oatmeal, then a small pot of tea. I use my own small teapots for keeping my made tea hot until it's finished...the hotplate keeps it very hot. I accidentally ordered 2 (didn't notice until they arrived) and after using one I decided to keep the other in case this one breaks. At twelve dollars and some change I couldn't go wrong with trying this to see if it would meet my needs...it does and it does it well. I am pleased. ETA: This isn't a coffee maker that you can pull out the carafe and the coffee will stop pouring out - it's a continuous drip through the filter into the carafe.  This is exactly what I wanted for making tea, I wanted the water to keep flowing into different sized teapots/mugs and not have to rely on only having to use their carafe. ETA: This is AWESOME! I had leftover tea from the night before and reheated it on the keep warm plate -- the tea got piping hot within an hour and I'm enjoying the rest of the tea.",Not Just For Coffee - TEA!,Amazon,7

I can buy 3 B&D for one zojirushi and if I break the next one I already ordered, I think B&D will be a serious contender.  Zojirushi is about 4 years old and still working as if new.  I can't say for B&D longevity, and will keep it for emergency times. Only weakness I see (trying new) with B&D is how the handle attaches to the pot.

4609,Black & Decker,"July 1, 2016","BLACK+DECKER 5-Cup Coffeemaker, Black, DCM600B",B001NXC5YC,1,"I always believe that price should be a factor in the overall rating of a product.  If something lacks many features and doesn't do as good of a job as a competing model, but is considerably cheaper, then you should go easy on the rating. This coffee maker is an entry level 5 cup coffee maker with no frills.  It's worth mentioning that all coffee makers advertise their cups based on a 6 oz cup, which almost no one uses.  I use a large coffee mug and can fill it twice with one batch of coffee from this thing, but thats not why I rated it low. Its a no-frills and basic coffee maker with a cheap carafe that I doubt will last more than a few washings.  Comparing the thickness of the glass of this carage to that of a $15 Mr. Coffee 10-cup maker that I also have and the glass on this Black & Decker 5-cup carafe is noticeably thinner.  Corners were cut to use as little glass as possible to make this carafe, so be very careful when cleaning it as a gentle bump in the wrong location will most likely break it.  The very thin glass carafe is probably worth docking 1 or maybe 2 stars at the most. The reason I gave this 1 star is for safety.  This coffee maker lacks one rudimentary feature that I believe ALL coffee makers, no matter how cheap they are, should have.  And that is an automatic shut off switch.  For B&D to have designed a self shut off switch in the electrical circuitry of this coffee maker would have cost them maybe a penny or two.  To have a coffee maker who will leave it's burned on indefinitely in 2016 is absolutely inexcusable. Another nitpick of the power switch for this machine is that the orientation is backwards of most up/down power switches.  In most consumer products sold in the United States, its pretty typical for 'Up' to be 'On', and 'Down' to be 'Off'.  Not here, up is off, and down is on.  Stupid. Sure, this coffee maker is only $11.99, but coffee makers costing $3-$4 more have an auto shut off feature and a more logical power switch.  For me, this machine is not worth $11.99. Spend a couple of extra bucks and save yourself the risk of an electrical fire by getting a model that can turn itself off. Amazon should remove this product from their website as it is irresponsible to sell anything like this with a heating element that will stay on forever.","This product lacks an automatic shut off feature and will leave it's burner on forever, major safety issue, do not buy!",Amazon,3

The lid seems to close better.  Here's hoping it'll last a lot longer too. You get what you pay for.  I bought this August 15th.  I've used it on average 3 times a week and now it died.  It won't heat water anymore.  It didn't even last 8 months.  I did save money from not needing to buy coffee anywhere else, but this is definitely disposable in quality not just price. When it did work, it worked OK, I usually found it boiled off more water than it claimed it should (if I filled to the 5 cup fill line*; sometimes I'd have 4 cups, sometimes 4.5, I never had 5 cups as expected) * There is a fill line higher than the cup line that is supposed to get you X cups, yeah it wasn't reliable on how much it would make on a given day. Other than that, it did make coffee, for a time.  It kept it warm if I didn't fit it all into a single cup/container as well.",You get what you pay for..,Amazon,0

Con: 1/ no auto switch is an issue if you're not used to it. 2/ no sneak-a-cup/brewing pause feature turns out to be a deal breaker for me; waiting and staring at it till it's done brewing and dripping is depressing...

The caffeine withdrawal (that is probably all in my head) finally made replacing it a priority. I found this little gem.  The price was an offer that I couldn't refuse, even if it was a temporary replacement until I found something else.  That's not the case with this coffee maker.  After using it a few times, I realized I got a really great deal on a really good product. This is a smaller coffee maker which makes it nice because it opens up a lot of possibilities in where I could put it in the kitchen.  It brews 5 cups which is perfect for one or two people.  If you have a lot of coffee drinkers in your home or office then this one would not work for you.  In fact, the size is small enough that I was a little worried about it at first until I used it.  My last coffee maker was a 12 cup unit so if that's what you are used to, the difference is going to be quite noticeable but I think that is part of this unit's charm.  The size also makes this one a good choice for anyone that has a smaller kitchen, for dorm rooms, studio apartments or anyone that is limited in the amount of space that they have.  There are no special bells or whistles on this little guy.  It does one specific job.  It brews and it brews well.  No clock, no timer.  Just the basics. This Black & Decker coffee maker does require coffee filters.  Even though it is a smaller unit, the regular size filters fit just fine.  The filter basket is removable which is a HUGE plus for cleaning. Brew speed is good.  Since it is only brewing a maximum of 5 cups, it only takes a few minutes if you are brewing a full pot.  I like that because when the smell of fresh brewed coffee hits my nose, I want that first cup right now and this coffee maker accommodates that urge. All in all I'm extremely pleased with this purchase.  I have been using this one for a week now and couldn't be happier.  At this price I will probably pick up a few more as gifts for friends and family.  Anyone that uses a coffee maker that needs a compact model really needs this one in their life! ***UPDATE September 18, 2017*** Just wanted to take a second and say that this coffee maker is still going strong!  It has been used to brew a full pot once (sometimes twice) a day since the day it arrived and it is still working like it did when it came out of the box.

I also am limited in counter top space in my kitchen so it had to have a small footprint. I settled on this Black and Decker model. Sorry Amazon, I found it elsewhere at a cheaper price (at the time)!  And for the money I could not be happier with it. I get the thing with K Cup is that it's convenient and you only use 1 cup with no waste. Forget K Cup!  This coffee maker will make me one mug of coffee which is usually enough for me.  If I want more, it will make me more.  If I want it stronger, I can make it stronger (can't do that with pre-measured K cups!). There aren't any 'bells and whistles' with this coffee maker. No automatic timer, no remote control and no text notifications that 'your coffee is ready'.  Just an on / off switch.  That is fine by me.

I actually have saved all the pots from my coffee maker for cooking later and find the Black and Decker spout to be perfect for pouring. I had a kitchenaid once and the spout was not very good as it aged it spilled liquid everywhere. My old pot is still used to make and pour pancake batter though. I love it. I know some people who have had these that don't like the type of coffee pot because it isn't thermal insulated. I think it's personal preference. I think this is a good buy for the price. This is the first time I have shipped a coffee maker and it arrived in good working order.

Of course that‚Äôs their way of making sure that my current coffeemaker is broken and does not work ‚Äì they aren‚Äôt about to send me a new unit unless they KNOW I can‚Äôt use the old one at all. And if they make a profit on me paying $13.99 on Amazon, Spectrum‚Äôs cost is probably about $7 tops ‚Äì and yet they see fit to make me feel like they believe I could by lying. Like my daughter said it‚Äôs NOT a Keurig coffeemaker! Amazon would never have doubted me. Money is tight right now because I'm on medical leave from work, so when I have the money to buy a better coffeemaker, I will ‚Äì and until then, I suffer along with this one until it dies ‚Äì and hope it works most days. I won't buy a Black & Decker - that's for certain. UPDATE: I changed my 5-star review to one star. I bought this on March 16 of this year - it is August 16 today, 5 months later, and it no longer works. The light comes on, it appears to heat the water, but it does not run the water through anymore - so no coffee for me this morning.  My 17 year old cat is dying and I've been up almost all night, so thanks a lot, Black & Decker for completely ruining my day. Nice little pot, and it fits in a very small space, which is all I had. Coffee is good. I don't need a timer or a clock on my coffeemaker so this is just right. Good price and it arrived quickly. I have a Black & Decker one cup coffee maker and like that one also - I've had it for 3 years and it still works great. My electric drill and screw driver is Black & Decker and when one dies, I buy another because they charge quickly and work great. I would not have thought of Black & Decker as synonymous  with 'coffeemaker' - but I'm happy with them just the same. Another Amazon winner!","AFTER 5 MONTHS, IT ONLY BREWS OCCASIONALLY",Amazon,2

This is an inexpensive unit purchased as a giveaway until my own coffeemaker coincidentally broke that same week. After using it for a few weeks, I can only give it three stars. Main problem is that there's no brew interrupt. I.e., you cannot remove the carafe until the coffee is completely brewed. If you do then coffee spills onto the hotplate. Once the brewing seems to cease, there's still a good amount of coffee pouring down and unless one checks by peeking through the 1/4' gap to spot black coffee against the black plastic. coffee will spill. And that's a tragic. For a hotel room or as a backup coffeemaker this is adequate. As a daily brewer it's not.","Flawed design, but inexpensive.",Amazon,5

Cons: Poor quality-only lasted about 9 months of daily use. Bad basket design harms coffee flavor. No sneak-a-cup feature. Immediately upon using this coffee maker I was unhappy with the coffee it brewed. It was too weak. A quick peek inside the basket showed me why: the ridges in the bottom of the basket are too small, forcing all the water to funnel toward the middle, digging a little hole as it flows and skipping most of the coffee grounds. I worked around this by placing an extra coffee filter on *top* of the grounds. (I know, wasteful, but it worked.) Also, there's no sneak-a-cup feature, so when the coffee is finished brewing you still need to wait a couple of minutes to serve yourself because the basket will keep dripping for a while. I was constantly dripping coffee onto the warming plate. I disliked this model so much that I finally just ordered a new Mr. Coffee in black from Amazon and dawdled a few weeks about switching it out until the Black and Decker made it easy for me by dying after about 9 months of use. To be fair, I probably brew 3 to 4 pots of coffee a day, but I'd been doing that with my old Mr. Coffee for about a decade and it was still going strong.

Before we had a very old Mr. Coffee coffee maker and it was wonderful.  I tried to find the same thing, but couldn't and this was the closest I could find was this B&D 5-cup coffee maker. We've had ours for about a year and it does okay.  I just don't like the design as much.  I wish the on/off switch was in the front and that you could visibly see it's still on, but you have to look to the side. And, I learned the hard way that if you open the lid while coffee is being made, you can get hurt as the water sort of spurts out.  That never happened with Mr. Coffee.  I would have preferred a 4 cup, but it's okay that it's 5 cup.  I don't drink coffee, rather my husband, so I cannot say anything about how the coffee tastes, but he hasn't complained, so I'm guessing it's fine. A few times, not sure why, the water got stuck.  Even though I regularly clean it, it just kind of stuck and wouldn't drip. I gave it 3 stars because it was just average and I thought because it was newer that it would totally be a lot better.  The look is sleaker, but it's just less functionally good as my previous old, hand me down Mr. Coffee. Update 1/7/2016 Had this coffee maker for over a year.  It does not last.  There is something intermittently wrong with the thing that drops water from the water reservoir into the area where there is the hole that drips down into the coffee pot.  In the past, it would spew out water if you lifted this while it worked.  I get it.  Stopped doing that.  Now there is an intermittent leak underneath the coffee pot.  Not quite sure where.  And our maker continues to make noise if you do not turn off the coffee pot.  It used to not do that.  Very annoying. Anyway, last Saturday, I decided to switch back to getting a Mr. Coffee coffee pot since our old one last MANY years without any issues. This coffee maker gets cleaned periodically, so it's not like anything is clogged.  It's a nice looking coffee maker, and simple to use.

It works! No bells and whistles in an era of hi-tech appliances. I am NOT a coffee connoisseur per se; I am fine with instant coffee; however, I really, really enjoyed the coffee that I drank in South India many years ago, which is a combination of coffee and chicory. I've had a bag of this mix sitting in the fridge for far too long (after flunking French Press Coffee Making 101) and that's what I used to inaugurate my first coffeemaker in a long, long time. You can fill the water reservoir over the indicated 5-cup mark but not too far or it will come out of the two holes in the back. Good idea -- the carafe won't overfill as a result. For people who don't need a huge pot of coffee to sustain them, this size works. The coffee turned out surprisingly good for having been stashed in the fridge for so long.

But you have to be attentive because there is no automatic shutoff and also patient because it keeps dripping when you move the pot.  It is simple and easy.  It also doesn't tell time so if you need a clock buy a microwave instead.  Good for about two and a half large coffee mugs full.  So if you love coffee it is good for just you and if you like coffee a lot you can share it with another person.  Drink within three minutes of brew completion or the coffee will be too hot on the warmer and burn over time.  It is brewed at the perfect temperature if you drink it right away and no, that is not scorching hot, it is the perfect temperature for the full flavor of the bean.  I use 8 flat tablespoons per full pot (5 cup), drip grind.  It is stronger than a normal coffee pot due to the smaller area for the water to go through the beans, which is awesome because you will use less coffee when you make coffee.  I recommend keeping it clean, rinse it after you use it and never let wet beans sit because they will get moldy and that's gross.  For the perfect brew, use water from your refrigerator (cold water) or add two ice cubes if the water is warm or tap.  Cold water creates the best brew.  Never use hot water as it will overheat the plastic and you will get a nice plastic flavor.  Also, buy good coffee and only use Swiss or natural process decaf because the rest tastes like chemicals.  I have had success with Java Delight's Columbian dark roast, Boyd's French Roast, most Starbuck's coffee, Decaf Peace Coffee (my favorite but expensive), and any other coffee that is not instant and costs more than $10 a bag.  I mentioned some that aren't because they are exceptions and if you are on a budget they will be the best for you and they go on sale sometimes. I stand by this coffee maker.  It is cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the carafe if you break that too, it is glass so you know, treat it like glass.  If you grasp the concept of coffee this should be an easy machine to use.  You can use most generic filters, I recommend non-bleached for no real reason beside there is no bleach used in them.  Buy some on amazon, they are cheap in bulk.  It is also best if you grind your coffee fresh right before brewing and keep it in an airtight container when not in use.  Dispose of coffee grinds after use.  You can get nice glass jars from Walmart or Amazon that work great for storage.  Do not keep the beans cold unless you are going to drink one cup every six months.  You should not have beans last more than six months at the most and that is for fresh whole beans.  Pre-ground store-bought coffee may taste the same after more time, but it probably wasn't that fresh in the first place.  Get an automatic Bodom burr grinder, the good one where you can set the grind and time.  Keep it clean and don't let the beans sit too long ground or whole.  It is around $100 on amazon right now, see?  You can have really expensive tastes and love this coffee maker if you know what you are doing.  I do 20-25 seconds on the coffee post setting depending on the freshness of the bean.  As someone who is deeply in love with the oily beany taste of strong freshly-brewed coffee that isn't too acidic or bitter, I will tell you right now this maker can be perfect.  You just have to follow my instructions and be on top of it.","Everything you need to know about this coffee maker, as someone who has used a few of them for over 10 years.",Amazon,2

B&D's instruction sheet makes no mention of which filters to use. 2- Unlike my two previous 4-cup coffee makers (Farberware, then MrCoffee), the B&D does not have the little spring-loaded shut-off that prevents coffee from dripping onto the hot plate when you remove the urn to pour coffee. So you have to wait until the machine goes silent for a while, then grab the urn & pour. I waited about a minute & removed the urn to pour some coffee. Just as I started pouring, the machine gave a final burp and dripped a stream of coffee onto the bare hot plate. Bummers! 3- Unlike my previous two coffee makers, the B&D's flip-top on the urn is not readily removable. So washing the urn is not as easy as it would be if the lid were removable.

Special thanks for three things:  First, the carafe pours without dribbling!  (After you've been frustrated by others, you'll really appreciate this.)  Second, there's a thermometer-like window on the side of the coffeemaker (you can see it in the product photo) that clearly shows the water level. Third, the carafe has something we'd never seen before: each level (2, 3, 4, and 5 cups) has two level-lines (nicely explained at the top of the carafe, with both words and symbols): one for coffee (that is, after brewing), and another for water (before brewing) -- that one marked a little higher than the first one, to allow for water being absorbed in the coffee grounds.  The marks are accurate!

I hope that over time it will go away, or at least fade.  It tends to throw off the flavor of the coffee. The water runs through it a little too quickly, so sometimes there are grounds in the bottom of the pot.  Also, the basket size is between a 4 and 6 cup size permanent filter, so I bought the smaller of the two, and have to watch the quantity of coffee carefully, or stop the brewing partway through to give the water time to settle through the grounds.

It brews fine coffee. One year ago, I dropped the Smart Brew's carafe. I couldn't find a replacement so ended up getting this little guy. It's a very similar design to the earlier unit, but the coffee's much, much weaker. Maybe it's something to do with the temperature or the flow rate. Other reviewers seem to be getting mixed results, so maybe there are variations in the makers themselves. We eventually resolved the situation by putting the new carafe on the old maker and sticking a steel steamer pot (the kind for cappuccino) under the new one. Given a steamer pot half-full of oats and half an hour to work on it, it makes reasonable oatmeal to go with the old maker's coffee. So three stars on the hope that I got either a dud coffee maker or a mis-labeled oatmeal maker. Things you should know about these makers: They don't automatically turn off. They don't automatically turn on. They don't automatically do anything other than drip. If you want coffee for breakfast, turn it on before you hop in the shower and turn it off after you pour your cup. They automatically drip. They do not automatically stop dripping. There's no 'someone took my carafe away' valve, so if you take the carafe out while it's running, it will keep right on automatically dripping into the empty space where the carafe used to be.

The packets require you to empty the contents in hot water and stir so what I really needed was a quick and easy hot water maker. I looked at hot water kettles but the reviews of those had drawbacks from flimsy construction to rusting. So I bought and tried this. It works great with instant coffee and it is very low cost. Just put the instant coffee in the plastic filter basket with NO PAPER FILTER. The coffee maker has a shower head type water sprayer that sprays hot water into the filter basket. This effectively and thoroughly dissolves the coffee and when it goes into the carafe it is ready to drink. I actually place a big mug under the spout instead of the included carafe and I don't have to even pour. I place a large 20oz mug under the spout. I pour water into the coffee maker to the 3.5 cup level. In a short while the cup is full and the coffee is actually darker and stronger than it would be if I just put the coffee in hot water and stirred. The one packet is supposed to make one cup (5 to 8 oz) but I use the one pack to make about 16oz. The coffee is dark and strong enough for me.

It's a good little coffee maker for the price.  I'm happy with it.  It's as simple as you can get which is what I wanted. I didn't want or need anything with a bunch of bells and whistles. It is easy to clean and fits regular basket filters, which is a plus.  I gave it four stars because for the sake of honesty it does have a few minor issues that might bother some people.  I'm not bother by them a whole lot though. 1.  It takes somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes to brew.  I know  some people want it done faster but I just start it before I do anything else in the morning and that works for me.  I'm not ready for coffee the second my feet hit the floor anyway. 2. It does tend to collect condensation around the outside.  A little annoying but I just make sure to wipe it up when I see it. 3. Some people also complained about the lack of an automatic shut off.  I kind of wish it had that feature but I guess the lack of it just makes me pay better attention to what I am doing.  Maybe that's not such a bad thing! 4. I haven't had too much trouble with it dripping coffee on the hot plate as some reviewers noted.  Maybe they're trying to pull the pot away before it is totally done dripping? Every coffee maker I've ever had requires a moment or two for the last couple of drips to stop.  Any drips I do get I mop up right away and my hot plate looks fine. 5. The pot does get a little messy when you pour. I've had that problem with other coffee makers too.  I've learned to avoid a mess simply by pouring over the sink and then wiping off the pot with the dish cloth.  Problem solved. Overall I'm happy with this coffee maker.

Opted this this little unit and it was exactly what I needed for my morning cup of joe. It makes '5 cups' of coffee - which in the real world means it make 3 full mugs of coffee - in about 5 minutes, give or take. As 3 mugs is my limit for the day, the amount is perfect. If you are considering this machine there are three  things you need to be aware of in case you have been spoiled by the bells and whistles found on pricier units - there is no 'pause and pour' feature, you can't program it to start as a certain time and there is no automatic shut-off after a set period of time. You flip it on, wait until it is done brewing before pouring your first cup and it stays on until you turn it off. Just like the 1970s. I have no problem with such a simple, basic machine, but if you want coffee already brewed when you wake up and can't remember to turn the machine off before walking out the door, this might not be a good choice for you.

I liked the look of this one better, and how compact it was so I decided to give it a try.  Most of the small appliances in my kitchen are Black and Decker so I expected to like this coffee maker just fine but unfortunately it falls short.  First of all, (this is irrelevant to right handed people), but with my Mr. Coffee the On/ Off switch was on the front and so it was more comfortable to flip the switch for a left hander like me, and also the coffee pot would stay put as I pushed the switch  since its braced against the wall it would only require using one hand to push it. But with this Black and Decker, the on/ off switch is on the right hand SIDE so I have to reach around it awkwardly to turn it off, and the coffeemaker always ends up getting slid to the left on the counter-top as I push the switch, if I don't use my other hand to hold it steady.  It sounds like a little thing,  but it gets annoying morning after morning. If you're a lefty like me you already have enough little annoyances in your life to deal with. Coffee first thing in the morning should not be one of them.  Additionally, the clear window to view how many cups of water you've added on the Black and Decker is only on the right side, not both sides like the Mr. Coffee has.   The next annoying thing about this coffeemaker is the fact that you have to wait till it's entirely done making the coffee before you can remove the carafe and pour yourself a cup. My Mr. Coffee on the other hand was self sealing, it would plug itself automatically and stop dripping when the carafe was removed, (but still keep working), so that you didn't have to wait for all the water to filter through before quickly pouring yourself a cup. So unless you wait for the last drop to filter through this black and decker coffeemaker, you're going to have some drips. Probably a lot of drips.  and because of those drips ending up on the hot plate that the carafe sits on, keeping it WET, the black coating on the hot plate is peeling off.  I've only had mine for a few months now and a lot of the black coating has already come off.  That NEVER happened with my mr. coffee. (probably because my mr. coffee didnt drip all over the place!)  And usually now  there are coffee stains on my counter to wipe up as well.  Other than that, it makes coffee just fine.

I have to pour slowly and carefully, which is not my tendency when I'm in a hurry! Even then I always spill a little. I suspect any similarly priced and similarly simple coffee maker would be better.

The carafe in the picture looks different and mine definitely had a cut-off but no mention of one in new description. This to me is what a small coffee pot should be. The coffee temperature is right and it cuts off properly. When my girlfriend also wanted a small coffee pot she had me buy her a cuisinart. I suspect she didn't want a Black and Decker name on her counter top. I hate hers. The differences: B&D has a glass carafe, Cuisinart has metal. Although glass is capable of breaking, I never have. However, with glass, you see see what's going on immediately while she's made new coffee in the cuisinart when there was still coffee left in it and overflowed onto the counter. Coffee also cools faster in the metal carafe than the glass and seems to 'burn' faster. Both Mr. Coffee and Cuisinart have the feature of pouring a cup of coffee while it's still being made. It's a feature I don't like because 1) coffee poured during the brewing has a different strength and 2) if carafe isn't put in perfectly, it half-triggers the valve and can leak over the counter top. B&D's carafe is well designed and pours nicely. Cuisinart's doesn't, it requires almost a 90 degree lifting of the carafe to get all the coffee and steam flows over your hand. The only disadvantage to the B&D is that it uses the basket style filter rather than a Melitta filter that I think is more efficient but the basket does accept both the 4-cup filters and the 12 cup filters. I am replacing the current coffee pot because the plastic hinges on the lid have worn out so it doesn't flap conveniently.

As others have mentioned in these coffee maker reviews, the advent of pod-style coffee makers and single mug coffee makers have decimated the small drip coffee maker market. I can't find one in most department stores. Mr. Coffee has made their hotel model their star small coffee maker, which is 4 - 5oz cups, or about 20 oz, which is too small for me. They used to have a larger 5 cup model but it seems to be unavailable. Pod style machines make weak under-extracted coffee that costs at least 50¬¢ a cup. I like to have at least 2 16-oz mugs of coffee in the morning, meaning I want something that makes at least 30 oz of coffee at a time so I don't have to brew 2 pots/mugs. Enter this Black & Decker model. It's real basic, which is pleasant. A basket-style maker that makes about 30 oz of coffee. It has no timer, no clock, no automatic shutoff, and no insanely bright LEDs. The design is simple and easy to clean. The one drawback that will cause me to return this is that it makes poor coffee. I'm using the same coffee in the same amount, with the same amount of water as with my previous (cone-style) maker. The resulting coffee is thin in body, pale in color, and weak in flavor. The water isn't hot enough, or it isn't in contact with the coffee long enough - I don't know, but it's not very good. Looks like I'm going to have to pay some serious $$ to get something suitable.

Most 4-cup filters (like the Melitta 1-4 Cup filters) work fine for four cups, but they have a tendency to overflow a bit if you make the full five cups.

Every morning at least two big, big cups.  For over seven years however I was very pleased each day with the flavor with my Black & Decker 5 cupper.  Originally, I think I just happen to find it at a local store, was the right size for my office.  It made better coffee than my full size rig at home.. very impressive for a little economy auto drip I thought.  And then it happened, about a month ago the carafe broke and I always knew that someday it would.  Incidentally, there was an acceptable amount of rust on the burner for a 7 year-old unit.  It looked like about the same price for a new maker as it would for just a replacement carafe so I went for it knowing I would be replacing both parts at some point.  An exact match for my favorite little model was nowhere to be found but there were at least 10 nearly identical 5 cup makers on the market.  So I picked one, not the cheapest and not the fanciest, and bought it. Shipping was quick.  I brewed the recommended no-grounds pot and almost passed out from the smell coming from the device and the produced hot water.  Emitting from the maker and the output water was a plastic odor that was more offensive than many cleaning products.  I tried making another pot of just water but it was still reeking beyond believe.  I made several pots of coffee (and by coffee I mean completely discussing, hot brown plasticky liquid to borrow from another person's review of a different B&W model).  And after that then more pots of just water, all of which came out with a terrible plastic smell.  Honestly, I tried a cup of the coffee at one point but couldn't finish it due to the smell. B&D customer service was not bad.  I was told that there were no similar issues on file based on the model and lot number.  They sent me an upgrade model. The DCM675WF didn't smell quite as bad but it is definitely not okay either.  Same basic observations; it makes smelly hot water for couple of cycles.  Then attempting brewing coffee is something that just shouldn't ever happen.  Beautiful fresh ground beans are run through the machine and out comes hot, coffee-like plastic-smelling water.  Again, tried to drink one cup, couldn't finish it because of the odor.  Honestly, I am slightly worried for my safety just from two partial cups.  And worse, there are probably people with diminished sense of taste (i.e. smokers) drinking pot after pot out of these things with no idea that the Chinese plastic is leaching things into their coffee that didn't even have names 10 years ago let alone any health impact studies.

You won't fit a tall travel mug in there, but that's fine by me. * The coffee comes out at 160 degrees Fahrenheit, so you'll get a good hot cup of coffee. * It has a hot plate, which I think is a waste.  This coffee maker is perfect for making a mug at a time.  I'd rather brew a second cup then keep a cup warm in the carafe.  I absolutely hate the taste of burnt coffee that you get very quickly when you leave it on the hot plate.  Although, it does act as a cup warmer while the coffee is brewing, so I may change my mind on this. * You can see the water level in the reservoir if you're not using a measuring cup or the carafe to measure the water. * The carafe has water level markings that show the 'extra' water you need to use to account for the water that is absorbed by the coffee grounds.",Great coffee maker for one,Amazon,96

In order to rectify the problem, I had to cut away part of the lid.  Do-it-yourself coffee pot? The second problem is that the unit I received had little plastic tabs on the bottom that had been extruded too much, so that they extended beyond the little rubber feet on the bottom.  The result is that the unit slid all over the counter top. I had to clip off the ends of these tabs.  DIY coffee-maker feet? Finally, a more minor point.  The on/off switch is very stiff.

This is a completely no-frills device, but it makes coffee...v-e-r-y slowly (make sure you get it going with enough time before you need to pour your coffee).  There's no timer to let you set it the night before.  It does have two holes in the back of the water tank to let water spill out if you try to fill it with more water than the carafe can hold.  So, to keep it from spilling coffee on your counter it just immediately spills water onto your counter.  This becomes somewhat complicated since the entire coffee-maker is black.  If the area behind the coffee-maker is dark, you won't be able to see the overflow holes so you won't know when to stop pouring water.  Sure, there is a measure on the side, but it is black, everything is black, and you will have to put your face right up against the side to see where the water level is, and look from different angles until you catch the light just the right way so you can read the indicator.

I tried to keep it alive, cleaning and vinegaring its little innards, but there was nothing I could do to save it.  Assuming it was a lemon, I foolishly bought another one two months ago. It's now showing the same symptoms, working slower and slower and making more and more noise in the process. I'm giving it constant encouragement and keeping it clean as a whistle because it's such a great size for a one coffee-drinker household, and it makes a pretty decent cup of coffee.  But I don't hold much hope for it.  When it's gone I'll bid it a sad farewell and find a more reliable replacement.",Short Lifespan,Amazon,7

Old fashion simple design . The serve and pause feature is one feature that breaks easy. The 5 cup capacity is unique . It's not too small and not to big. But the biggest draw for this model is that  I don't need to use the carafe  if I only need a  small 16 oz of coffee , all I  need is to put my mug instead of the carafe. Most mug will fit under  this model. with pause and serve model , it is not possible . The newest single serve coffee will cost $35- $150 dollars like the Kurig but we will have to buy a coffee that will fit in the machine which in the long run could cost more . So  overall by price and convenient  Black & Decker DCMM600W  is the winner. I am ordering my 4th one. I give one as a gift . I put one at work and I gave away one to my daughter so Ineed one at home for myself.Hopefully  black  and Decker will continue this model.

We tried this as the closest thing we could find, but after trying it for two weeks, it's going in the Salvation Army box and I've ordered a new Mr Coffee like the old one we had. This model just has a number of dumb design deficiencies that make it not worth keeping: 1) The pot drips! Yes, if you're REALLY careful, you can pour a cup of coffee without some drops ending up on the table or the counter, but why should it be that hard? Mr Coffee never dripped. My wife and I both felt that this model should come with a sponge, because you're going to need it to clean up after every cup you pour. 2) The on/off switch is on the side, making it easy to forget to turn the thing off. Mr Coffee put the switch front & center, making it easy to see. 3) This gadget has rubber feet, but they're slippery. If you want to work the on/off switch, it's a two handed operation: one to flip the switch and the other to push against the other side of the coffee maker to keep it from scooting across the counter.

After having the pot several more months, I have noticed that the hot plate does get corroded from hot coffee dripping on it.  Also, one other problem, which has also been mentioned by other reviewers is that pouring out the coffee can get messy - it tends to drip and dribble unless you pour slowly and keep the lid raised while pouring.  However, considering how much use I get out of it (at least three pots of coffee or hot water a day), I'm still happy with it and my original rating of four stars stands.  If B & D can come up with a better, non-drip carafe and a hot plate that doesn't corrode, they'd earn five stars from me. The Black & Decker 5-cup coffeemaker is a good little basic pot for those times when you only need to make enough coffee for one or two people.  I generally use a 16 oz. mug for my coffee and with this pot I get almost two mugs full.  One of the other reviewers mentioned that the hot plate portion of their pot had corroded from the coffee dripping onto it.  I haven't had that problem but I've only had my pot for about three months.  There are no bells and whistles with this machine - no timers, automatic shutoff, etc.  It's just a good basic coffeemaker for people who don't want to make a big pot of coffee when all they want is a cup or two.","No bells and whistles, just a good little coffee maker",Amazon,21

OK, call me 'insane' but I have liked the way it makes coffee and will just put up with its drawbacks which I wish B&D would fix: (1) Without a Pause(to stop drips) it still can drip and any water/coffee that falls on the hot plate WILL corrode it over time.  On my second one of this model I even covered the hot plate with foil at the outset to prevent the corrosion but over time (a year or little over) the foil corroded and, thus, the hot plate; (2) On/Off button broke.  On this second model, the On/Off button simply cracked and then fell off.  I had to discard this coffeemaker due to the danger of electrical shock.
