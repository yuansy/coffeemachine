10,Braun,"December 18, 2018","Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker, White",B07CPJF2BG,4,"First, the good news: I like pretty much everything about this coffee maker. Daily, I use about 5 'measuring' cups of filtered water to go with a good 5 tablespoons of high-quality coffee beans that I grind separately. This produces about 3 generic size coffee cups of finished coffee. Plus, it's big enough for having company. Quickly, efficiently, delicious. I periodically clean it with a combination of water and vinegar. Note to first time users: When separating the carafe's lid from the pot for cleaning, there's no need to muscle up on it. Simply pull the front up and gently wiggle it back and forth. It will separate on its own. The bad news:  And this is all post-purchase oriented. When I bought the white version in October, 2018, it was $80. Which is fine. As of now, slightly over 2 months later, its going for around $60 - $65. Which is great. But the replacement GLASS carafe (part # BRSC005) goes for around $25 pretty much standard anywhere. That's just under half the total cost of a new coffee maker - same model.  RIDICULOUS, considering that replacing a glass carafe is a matter of 'when', not 'if'. Additionally, new replacement charcoal filters are disproportionately high priced as well. Having said all that, I'd buy it again. But the replacement parts are a rip.",Good news. Some bad news. Model KF6050WH.,Amazon,0

I tried this model and then went to other makers before realizing that they are all manufactured for SPEED instead of proper brewing for strength and richness.

Braun makes very nice items and this is no exception. Things I like?:  I like the overall footprint.  The looks with the great, green and white are appealing.  The overall quality is quite nice.  The build is quite good for what would be expected for this price point.  The carafe is glass as is haul for this price point.  Good controls.  Fairly easy to read.  This has the usual controls one would expect, including 'brew'! Things I dislike?:  I wonder about the longevity of the heating pad (usually these breakdown after a while).  The WORST thing about this machine is the stupid way in which there is no window to see how much water is in the reservoir.  I mean yes, I can look over the top and see a plastic ladder, but this presumes a certain height, it presumes a certain cabinet that this would make sense to do this on, and finally, it assumes enough light and cognitive ability early in the morning pre-coffee makes this possible.  Plus, asking you the user to unclog the machine before replacing the water is kind if a bad design flaw. Overall:  There is a lot to like here.  I love the look.  I love the way this is made.  But I detest the design flaw of not having a window to see how much water is in the reservoir.  I give this three stars because of this flaw.  I would rather not because I like this machine.

Takes about 10 min to brew a full pot, so that was an adjustment from my former Bunn, which only took 3-4 min. However, you can pre-program this pot to have coffee ready when you get up in the morning, which is nice and an upgrade from the Bunn. The auto-off was a bit of a mystery at first - the pot automatically shuts off after two hours (another upgrade from the Bunn and great for most mornings), but on weekend mornings,we wanted it to stay on longer.  You’ve got to read the directions to figure out how to accomplish this - program the auto off for up to 5 hours and then hit the button when you want to extend the time, so they could’ve made that feature a little easier (e.g. giving us an option to simply turn the warmer on manually).

The green measuring stick inside the machine is impossible to read without a flashlight. They really should make it so you can see it.

62,Braun,"August 19, 2018","Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker, White",B07CPJF2BG,3,"Model KF6050WH We have been using an old model of Braun 10-cup coffee maker for over 30 years, happily enough, with only minor complaints regarding the design features of that much simpler machine. This new one enjoys a similar commitment to careful engineering, but in the spirit of ever greater complexity and the addition of computerized features, it is a far more complex device and suffers from major drawbacks on that account. For example, all of the programming that one can do (setting the clock to the current time of day, setting the number of hours and minutes after which the machine will shut itself off, and telling the machine when you’d like it to automatically commence a brewing cycle) is lost if you unplug it, supposedly for longer than 60 seconds. So imagine you’ve got a double outlet in your older kitchen and one is used for the frig and the other is shared between the coffeemaker and the coffee grinder.  (The new power cord is an about 28”, two-pronged, polarized one.)  We always kept the coffee maker safe by unplugging it after use because it’s power switch was very easy to turn on by simply sliding something on the countertop and gently bumping into the switch.  That was the main design flaw of the older machine. There is simply no way to use this machine’s fancy electronic features if you need to routinely unplug it, unless very briefly, e.g. in order to use the grinder.  One must choose to simply power it off with the power button after the brewing cycle is complete, like the old machine, though pulling the cord is no longer necessary for safety.  Oddly enough though, the safety instructions in the user manual include the admonition to “Always fill the water reservoir first, then plug the cord into the wall outlet.” (??? This make little sense in the context of all the programmed settings being lost as a result of a brief loss of power, over some 60 seconds, nor should it be necessary for safety.)  Even the auto power off setting (the minimum time is 15 minutes, I wish it were 5 or zero) is lost, so the machine, if accidentally left powered on after brewing is complete, will continue to be “on” and will keep cycling the full power on intermittently, as though it were trying to keep the pot warm, whether there’s coffee in it or not and whether you’d want to keep cooking the coffee or not, for the default of 2 hours. Neither the product description online here nor the Braun website nor the printed user guide explains how the coffee maker uses power, a supremely important aspect of such a device.  My Kill-A-Watt says it uses about 930 watts when the heat is on (the rating is 1000 watts).  At the start of a normal brewing cycle (not the 1 to 4 cup cycle) the power goes on and remains on until about 20 or 30 seconds after the water stops being spewed out over the grounds.  It then enters a cycling pattern of about 9 seconds on and 2 minutes off, keeping the pot warm, until the auto-off period shuts down the machine, turning off the various panel lights but still drawing somewhere between about 1 and 7 watts.  The Kill-A-Watt says 1 watt but also says .06 amps, so at 120 volts that would mean 7 watts of power draw, not 1.  It’s probably close to 1, or at least it should be. It may be the case that there is only a single heating element in the device, and it’s located under the warming plate for the carafe, rather than one for boiling the water and another for heating the warming plate as I’d long imagined.  That’s probably why the power consumption, even in this newer machine, doesn’t fall from the high level used during brewing to a continuous few tens of watts just for keeping the pot warm.  I would prefer to not keep the pot warm and to rely instead on the microwave to warm subsequent cups as needed.  Better for the coffee’s flavor, better for controlling the coffee and milk temperature and less wasteful of electricity. The 1 to 4 cups brewing cycle seems to be only slightly different from the standard cycle.  At the start, the high power level cycles on and off a few times for the first minute or less instead of just turning on, then reverts to full on (~930 watts) for the rest of the brewing cycle just like the normal cycle, again turning off within 20 to 30 seconds after the water reservoir is emptied, then the pattern of intermittent warming is less aggressive, with the on cycle being perhaps one second shorter and the period between on cycles increasing to about 2 and a half minutes, i.e. a little less heat is used to maintain warmth of a presumed lesser amount of coffee in the carafe. Braun could easily adjust the warming cycle for an initial load of coffee in the pot by measuring the time required for the water in the reservoir to be emptied during the brewing cycle, which tells you how much coffee was just brewed.  But  then if a fraction of that coffee is poured from the carafe, the machine wouldn’t know it and wouldn’t adjust the warming cycle accordingly, in an attempt to keep the coffee in the pot at a particular temperature.  Which is part of the reason that the whole approach of increasing complexity seems just silly.  A bare-bones approach will in many scenarios work better.  For someone with an extra outlet and a regular morning schedule, the current design approach seems fine though. The other thing is that the machine is huge.  Wide, deep and tall.  Our older 10-cup machine drew ~800 watts, and had a cross sectional area about half of what this one has and was several inches shorter, both of which are advantages.  The new machine has a built-in charcoal filter, which they suggest replacing every two months, depending on how hard your water is, though hardness is perhaps not what it’s mainly about, rather residual chlorine in the tap water.  In theory this is a good thing for water purity, but that’ seems like way too much maintenance for real life.  In places with mediocre or poor water quality, it could be a very nice feature, however, despite the extra nuisance and expense.  Each new filter needs to be soaked for 15 minutes or more then rinsed well for 10 seconds, then installed.  It sits in the outlet of the water tank. It’s not obvious how the plastic cone which holds either a #4 paper filter or the gold colored reusable cone (apparently it’s not gold plated like they used to be or they’d say so) is removed from the machine.  Loading coffee from the Braun electric grinder into the cone is awkward compared to the old machine, though pouring water in is not particularly awkward.  There is a multi-stepped water level indicator thing in the reservoir so that you can measure water by aiming a flashlight down into the tank rather than by measuring how much you put in.  I think I’ll stick with measuring how much I put in. The carafe has a very nice feel to it, pours beautifully, and has one excellent little feature, a small click-resistance to keep the lid almost closed when pouring at a steep angle where it would otherwise fall open.  A “cup” is ~4 ounces.  We only need to brew more than 6 or 7 “cups” once every couple of years, so 12 cups is overkill for capacity.  Eight or 10 would be fine.  A double load can be done for entertaining. The retail box is well made but it’s not nearly sturdy enough for shipping of the product.  Our order was filled without the extra protection of a shipping box and the coffee maker was ruined on account of rough handling of the inadequate packing job.  The replacement arrived in perfect condition, however, despite the same packing approach.  But after checking it out for one day, I’m not as happy with the net effects of the design philosophy as I expected to be.  The coffee certainly tasted good and I suspect it was brewed quite optimally.",Complexity comes with drawbacks,Amazon,31

The Braun KF6050WH Brewsense Drip Coffee Maker is a well thought out appliance that has many conveniences, most of which I am excited to utilize. First off, it has a timer and you can program when to brew, etc.  This is like many coffee makers but what I found I liked is that you can set the maker to brew 1-4 cups of coffee or the whole pot.  Very convenient when you want just a small amount of coffee and don't have a Keurig. Second, the taste.  I found that the taste of the coffee seems a bit different -- more flavorful -- if that makes sense.  The Braun states it is because of the filter -- the coffee maker has a filter that doesn't use paper and I could be imagining things but I found the coffee to be a bit more robust and not as in your face as some.  There is also the added feature of this coffee maker having a filter to filter the water.  Pure ambrosia! Third, the design.  Straight up rectangle and it uses very little counter space in the kitchen.  I have a small kitchen and this is much welcomed in that I also don't have room to store a coffee pot daily out of sight.  The coffee maker I received was silver and blends in perfectly with my other appliances on the counter. The price is a bit more than I would pay for a coffee maker but for the convenience of the appliance design to the fact that it will brew 11 ounces to 12 cups with digital programming, the price seems about normal.

This makes it pretty useless unless there is amazing illumination on the front panel, which is not likely for a device likely to be under a counter. I don't really care to see the clock, but for changing settings it is useful to be able to see the display without a flashlight. 2  Speaking of needing a flashlight, you will need one to see far enough down into the reservoir to use the scale inside for measuring 2 or 4 cups of water.  It is a green plastic ladder scale that you have to be able to observe close enough to see when the water reaches the right rung.  And the numbers on the rungs are not colored so I end up having to count up or down to determine when to stop filling.  I fill from a Britta pitcher but if you are using the carafe to measure this may not be a biggie for you. 3.  If you are placing this under a kitchen counter (like me), you will need plenty or room to pull it out 100%, and then some, from under the top cabinets in order to get the lid open and to get the pitcher or carafe in a position near the back corner to pour water in.

91,Braun,"May 23, 2018","Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker, White",B07CPJF2BG,5,"While I've become a K-cup convenience convert in the last few years, I still like to make large half gallons of iced coffee, mocha Cappuccino blends with premium coffees.  I wasn't happy with my last machine it always made too bitter a brew, and seemed to take forever.  I used paper filters with it, and I could never match the hotel coffee I'd get on the job.  At work, I'd use double filters on the coffee to prevent too many bitters from going through, most made it too strong as well, so I'd made a fresh pot if there was a free decanter. The technology here works and works well.  I've been buying this cold brew base for my mocha blends and I had a few bottles to compare.  While it might be tempting to pour it over ice the best method for this is to pour the contents into a bottle. I use old large cold brew or Bolthouse Farm large bottles.  At the bottom I use a blend of coffee creamers, half and half, vanilla syrup, chocolate syrup, hazelnut syrup, (this takes the edge off the super hot brew) and shake them in the blend with the first few cups of the hot coffee, then add the rest, and put this in the fridge.  I attach the caps a bit loose at first and tighten them in an hour when the coffee is now colder. With the Braun, I was able to get remarkably close to the premium bottled from the major producers, and was happy with my production.  I could also experiment cheaply with some exotic blends fresh ground from the grocery using a conical burr machine.  I've had a couple of those at home, but they don't hold up for some reason, so I gave them away along with my old coffee machine.  Whether you are old school and don't want to deal with the expense and seeming waste ok K-cups, or are a larger family of coffee drinkers, this is recommended for you.  I'm unlikely to use it for single cup uses, but it does allow me to use that feature to sample, and try a few blends for taste before I ultimately bottle them chilled. You do save on paper coffee filters, and that plus the temperature control, helps this produce good flavorful coffee without the bitters.  I've thought you could only get that with an espresso type machine using pressured steam.  A proper ground, fresh from a quality bean roast will come very close with this machine.  I'm very sensitive about coffee flavor, and almost never drink coffee black, but I use black coffee to sample the quality, and this passes very well.  I have a manual espresso machine, and it's work for me to use, but it does make good coffee, considering this the difference is not much in taste, although, I can't (with the filter) use as fine a ground, so comparisons may be unfair.  still close is good. The design of this is simple and compact for a 12 cup maker the caraf design is for minimum air flow, and it cleans easily after use.  It has the usual array of high end timer features, so you can wake up the family to the smell of hot coffee.  A quick word about auto shut-off, on a number of occasions my old office would end up supper heating the coffee pots at the end of the day.  When I'd stay late I'd taken to checking to make sure even though I wasn't drinking much coffee back then.  I don't know why they don't have this smarter design on the more heavy duty machines, but it's true some don't.

I have gone through many different models; after a year or so, I generally donate my old one to a civic organization and start out fresh with a new coffeemaker. The BrewSense model has gone through a few improvements.  To begin with, they finally fixed the clock function, so that setting the accurate time is now quick and easy.  I had several problems setting the time with previous renditions of this model.  I set the time on the new machine several days ago, and thus far it is keeping perfect time.  My last one was stuck on a particular time and wouldn’t budge. Also, I am very glad that Braun has decided to go back to a clear glass carafe.  The solid metal carafe made it difficult to judge the water level as you were filling the reservoir.  I have always liked the permanent filter over paper filters; it is more economical and far handier. Finally, there’s the coffee.  Braun makes the best coffee of any machine I have tried.  The brew is consistent, rich and flavorful.  I always enjoy breakfast when my coffee is handled by a Braun machine.

Getting started with it may be a little weird: first you at the coffee, then put it on a kitchen scale and start adding water until a certain weight.  Sounds unwieldy, right? After the first time you should know how much water to add. You wait a while and a lot of the grounds to bloom, then add some more water going in a spiral, inwards and outwards a couple of times.  The stainless steel filter generally does a good job. And there you have it! A couple of caveats. When pouring out your coffee, you might actually want to avoid using the spout, as its shape seems to cause the coffee to pour in a chaotic manner, causing spills. Pour using a non-spout area of the glass piece and it’ll be neater. Another issue is disposal of the used grounds. It’s sounds better to have a reusable and washable filter, but keep in mind that you should not dispose of the grounds in your sink as it may clog up the plumbing and your disposal. As such you’ll have to figure out how to clean the filter in a way that avoids this problem. You may end up using paper filters inside the mesh filter anyway, to make disposal easier.

This Asobu insulated pourover coffee maker is a perfect solution and it really does keep the coffee hot for hours (you should preheat with some hot water though).

Other than that I love it. It’s also very easy to clean. I use a basic long handled kitchen brush which fits nicely into the 2 3/8” opening of the base and because of the short, squat shape (5.5” high, 5” wide bottom) the brush easily reaches all around the bottom and inside crevices.

Double-Wall Vacuum, Stainless-Steel Filter, Stays Hot Up to 12 Hours",B07FK4FQNJ,4,"We've been doing pour-over coffee off and on for years, starting long ago with chemex units.  We then used separate insulated carafes to store coffee to have it hot enough to drink those second and third cups with a meal. The various pour-over units worked but no matter whether a metal filter or plastic ones, sooner than later a problem developed (chipped plastic filters, clogged metal filters over time). And we had to keep pouring the coffee into separate containers. And none of the units were of the kind you'd put on a table when you had guests over. Now, this simply designed, multifunctional unit makes our lives easier while serving both functional and decorative purposes. I'll admit that I do wish I could see the amount of coffee in the container section, however, since I measure out the water I heat beforehand, that really isn't essential.  First, and foremost, it works. No metal filter clogging; very secure placement of metal filter in glass neck; ease of unscrewing the top piece from the metal insulated bottom. To be able to simply twist off the top part and putting on the lid makes this incredibly easy to keep coffee hot. Now, pouring the coffee out of the insulated container can be a bit messy as there is no 'pour' spout, simply a round top. But if you're careful, it will be fine. Admittedly, it's an awkward shape to hold to pour, but there are trade-offs. We use a pot holder placed underneath, that comes up the sides, to hold the bottom firmly without feeling any heat. I noticed that the black, rubber 'neck' that secures the top glass piece can get a bit warm when you're first pouring hot water over the coffee grounds, but it dissipates quickly, so you can hold/pour with it. Timewise, it seems to 'brew' as quickly as other units. And though I read and followed the directions about which way to pour the water (outside in, then inside out, then outside in again) the first few times we used it, I just went back to pouring from around the edge to center and then, as needed, depending on how the grounds congealed. It's stylish (I do wish there was a choice of colors for the metal insulated bottom, but the plum colored one we received is nice.) and doesn't take up much room at all. It seems fairly sturdy and cleans very easily. All in all, a good unit. We received a model to review from Vine and I do think the current price is a bit steep no matter how functional this unit is. Nice for small kitchens, dorms, RVs, etc. Most of all, coffee tastes great and stays hot and fresh for several hours.","Functional, well-designed pour-over coffeemaker + insulated container",Amazon,1

Double-Wall Vacuum, Stainless-Steel Filter, Stays Hot Up to 12 Hours",B07FK4FQNJ,5,"When I ordered this, there were no reviews and a spattering of posts from frustrated investors on Kickstarter. The situation looked a little sketchy and the product looked a little too good to be true. The seller, JavaFly, allayed my concerns and the item arrived with same day delivery. It has far exceeded my expectations. It's beautiful (I got the black one). The pour tastes better than my Chemex. The thermos keeps my coffee hot usually longer than I want to even keep drinking it. Both the thermos lid and the pour over appliance screw on and off easily. It's easy to clean, although, I do use paper filters inside the metal filter. I have been very happily surprised by this and a really glad I took the chance.",Awesome,Amazon,13

Double-Wall Vacuum, Stainless-Steel Filter, Stays Hot Up to 12 Hours",B07FK4FQNJ,5,"Ok, I do not often brew my coffee the regular way anymore, preferring expresso machines or single serves like Senseo. Yet, when I saw this Pour Over Coffee Maker, I decided to check it out. It is very stylish and simple to use in the same time. On top of this, it allows to keep the coffee warm for a few hours. The manufacturer claims up to 12 hours but who would want to drink old brewed coffee, still warm or not? You do not need paper filters because there is already a mesh filter provided. You just need to almost boil your water, pour it over the ground coffee (medium grind is the best) and let it drip. Once it is done, you can either remove the filter and use the glass top to pour your coffee or unscrew it to seal the coffee in the insulated container to use later. A nice and stylish reinvention of the oldest way to brew coffee!",Very stylish,Amazon,1

Double-Wall Vacuum, Stainless-Steel Filter, Stays Hot Up to 12 Hours",B07FK4FQNJ,5,"This Asobu Red Insulated Pour Over Coffee Maker- 32 oz capacity, is beautiful to look at as well as hold. The packaging is very protective and this would be lovely to receive as a gift. The double walled bottom vacuum container is sturdy and is balanced to hold a screw-on funnel shaped glass beaker, into which you place the stainless steel filter for your pour over.Tthe filter itself is well made, with a tack/rivet welded punched metal outer layer covering a very fine mesh inner lining (double layered filter). There is a convenient holding tab on the filter's edge as well. I followed the directions and used the recommended 1:15 coffee to water ratio- 66 grams coffee to 1000 grams water, using my scale. I don't have a pour over spout tea kettle, but just used my french press container for the water. The instructions say to 'bloom' the coffee w a first pourover, wetting all the coffee w 130 grams of water in 15 seconds, and then waiting 30 seconds.  The second and third pourovers require circling your water inward and outward from the edge to the center of the coffee grounds, taking about 45 seconds to a minute each pour, w a 30 second rest in between to drain.  You should pour in 1000 grams of water all together. I had a hard time doing this all while holding the camera and trying to set the timer and watching the scale...heh. i get the concept, but will not be quite this careful w the timing in the future. Bottom line tho is, the coffee came out great.- very robust, and tasted stronger but more unique flavored than the same coffee in my Aeropress. I actually could taste the different components of the coffee better. It has been 2 hours now, and my remaining coffee, which i capped with the lid after the brew, is still very very hot. I can feel no heat transfer through the walls of the vacuum container itself, and only a mild warmth coming off the cap. The container is effective, but somewhat hard to pick up, since it's nearly smoothly cone shaped all the way down to the counter. Still, for pourover lovers, this is a wonderful setup.",Utility and Beauty- Great Results,Amazon,0

The instructions call for a kitchen scale and a timer, though, which I do not have. I filled the thermos part with water to measure, and placed that amount of water in the pot to heat. You are supposed to weigh each amount of water that you pour over the coffee grounds, swirl the water in a certain manner, and time how long they drain. I was not this precise, and the coffee came out very delicious. The glass carafe assembly is still hot after pouring the first cup, so one must carefully remove in order to place the lid on the thermos. I was concerned that I would have to reattach the carafe for subsequent cups, but it is just as easy to pour from the lower thermos part. It is very nice to have hot coffee for later, and this brewing process does make very good coffee.",Simple Drip Coffee Brewing,Amazon,1
138,asobu,"September 7, 2018","Asobu Red Insulated Pour Over Coffee Maker (32 oz.) Double-Wall Vacuum, Stainless-Steel Filter, Stays Hot Up to 12 Hours",B07FK4FQNJ,4,"Pourover coffee is for geeks, imho. I avoid consuming food/liquid that has been heated in plastic, as in all automatic coffeemakers. I heat water in a metal kettle (the Cuisinart top-rated by Wirecutter), and usually use an insulated metal French press, because it's simpler than pourover, although messier to clean out. I had the Bodum one piece pourover setup, but what a pain to clean. This is much nicer to clean, and the built-in thermal carafe is handy. You can't put the bottom in the dishwasher, unlike my French press, because it might break the seal. The instructions actually say to handwash everything, but I am not going to hand wash a glass funnel or a stainless filter. Now, the instructions: for hard core geeks. They tell you to put the whole assembly on a digital scale. I could figure out why--my husband had to explain that you add the coffee until it increases the whole weight by 66 grams, and then add water as they specify. Seriously! I made decent coffee, imho, by just putting six cups worth of grounds (as measured by my Capresso burr grinder) in and slowly pouring some water in and stirring and waiting as they say, and then pouring some more in, and stirring the other way. Still, man, I just want some coffee! You're asking me to do all this before I have had my coffee!","Excellent quality and presentation, but awfully complicated before you've had coffee",Amazon,0

Double-Wall Vacuum, Stainless-Steel Filter, Stays Hot Up to 12 Hours",B07FK4FQNJ,4,"This fits approximately 4 1/2 cups of water - I used 12 tablespoons of coffee grounds. Brewing is straightforward.  With coffee grounds in the filter, almost no water touches the funnel, so it gets got but not hot enough to burn you. I've used this to make a few batches of coffee, and while I like it, there are a few quirks. 1) The odd shape of the carafe is difficult to pick up. 2) The cap is not insulated. After 25 minutes or so it can be too hot to touch. After pouring a couple of cups, it's not as hot. 3) It's not drip-proof - after pouring a cup some coffee runs down the side of the carafe. 4) The lid has to be on TIGHT or it will leak. Found that out the hard way. Really nice features: 1) Very easy to clean the filter. 2) The funnel has a lip in case the carafe is over-filled. 3) Keeps the coffer HOT for hours. 4) Love the color and styling 5) The carafe fits nicely on my desk, but I need to have napkins handy.","Classy, easy to use, some quirks.",Amazon,6

So, an immediate plus that this maker offers is its generous 32 ounce capacity.  It's also great to have a double wall storage container to keep the fresh coffee warm for hours.  I had thought the stainless steel filter would be a big plus in terms of eliminating the need to work with a paper filter, but I have decided that using the stainless steel filter alone lets the coffee flow through too quickly and the flavor of the coffee suffers from that.  I now just put the paper filter in the stainless filter basket and it works fine and gives me the stronger coffee flavor I prefer. Based on my trials and errors with various types of coffee makers, I'd recommend any coffee lover to have a good pour over maker like this one to use whenever the situation calls for making more than one cup.  It's more trouble than a drip maker and some other options, but I think the quality is worth it.",Outstanding Pour Over Maker,Amazon,4

In designing a coffee maker, I would want: 1. a pour over coffee brewing design; 2. no plastic exposure to hot water in the brewing process; 3. sturdy brewing pot not subject to breaking; 4. easy pouring from the pot into a cup; 5. an insulated carafe to keep brewed coffee hot and fresh; 6. a stainless steel micro brewing filter to provide bolder coffee flavor and eliminate paper waste and cost; 7. an elegant and attractive design; 8. a reasonable price. BINGO! Asobu encompasses all of these features in its remarkable coffee maker! The coffee brewed is excellent. The stainless steel micro mesh filter keeps grounds completely out of the pot/carafe and your cup. The insulated carafe keeps the brew hot and fresh without any burned or bitter taste from sitting on a warming plate. I have not tested the 12 hour claim of the carafe keeping the coffee hot, but over the course of 2-4 hours, my coffee has been perfect. The carafe holds about 32 ounces of brewed coffee (about 0.95 liters), perhaps a tad more. I had a difficult time choosing among the color choices, but I am very pleased with the copper color I picked. Typically I buy from Amazon but ordered this from another vendor that was $5 cheaper and accepted a 20% off coupon.",Asobu has all the features I wanted!,Amazon,4
