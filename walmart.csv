My friend loved it & is very pleased with her gift. I would by one for anyone needing a replacement or bigger pot. It's a 12 cup and pretty huge in my opinion but I'm used to a little 5 cup pot.

Don't leave it on all day. Let the pot cool before washing and should last a long time.

5,Mr. Coffee,"November 4, 2013","Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Switch Coffee Maker, Black (CG13)",9604635,2,We had an old Mr.Coffee with NO bells and whistles...it made the best coffee for at least 12 years before it quit working and we needed a new one . I buy organic beans and grind them fresh and I pour off the first 4 cups of coffee for the richest and most delicious coffee . So when choosing a new coffee pot I looked for the same no frills Mr. Coffee . This new one makes hot brown water !! The water runs through the grounds so fast that it cannot pick up the good coffee flavor ....I was so disappointed . I experimented with it for a week ...packing the grounds etc. ...but still only hot brown water . I realize now that good coffee is all about how the water drips through the grounds .... wish it was easy to find a good coffee maker. I am still looking .,Hot brown water,Walmart,23
6,Mr. Coffee,"February 2, 2017","Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Switch Coffee Maker, Black (CG13)",9604635,5,"Still the best coffee maker around for the price.  I have purchased many, many coffee makers over the years and the Mr. Coffee generally lasts the longest.  I recommend if you want the most longevity, get a plain coffee maker without any of the fancy electronics to go out, no clock to reset every time the poser goes out, etc.  This one is very simple, just an on off switch, which I prefer. (I hate having to keep re-starting the coffee pot, or forgetting to and finding the entire carafe cold because I forgot to reset the auto-off again. Mr. Coffee also has a large wide-open water reservoir to fill easily on a sleepy morning without pouring water all over! All coffee makers have a badly manufactured  brewer from time to time, but you are generally safer going with the Mr. Coffee if you want something inexpensive, yet still reasonable good quality.",Best coffee maker around for the price,Walmart,20

8,Mr. Coffee,"July 19, 2014","Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Switch Coffee Maker, Black (CG13)",9604635,5,"I used to use Braun, but they stopped making 110v coffee makers (only make 220v now). So I switched to Mr Coffee, I bought one with a clock / brew timer, and one with just an On/Off switch. Both previous Mr Coffee had the same four issues: 1. Carafe would drip/spill when you poured the first few cups of coffee (i.e. when it was full). 2. Pause 'N Serve would drip a few drops of coffee onto the hot plate whenever it was used. 3. Water would always be under the filter basket when you lifted it out to refill it for the next cycle. 4. Braun lasted five years, each Mr Coffee lasted under two years. I make a lot of coffee (two pots per day). A thermal fuse blew on the first unit. The second unit clogged, but I should have cleaned it with vinegar more often. This model is slightly different in appearance (i.e. on my other models, the grey in the front went all the way to the bottom of the Coffee Maker). I was surprised (and pleased) to find the first three issues have been fixed. Time will tell if longevity has been improved.",They fixed some problems,Walmart,13

The pot pours well, has side water gauges which I like, basket in and out is smooth operation and most important is that the temp of the coffee is adequate for me, 170 degrees.   Higher temp, coffee in pot to 180 would be from a machine many times more, over as hundred dollars, not 14 dollars.

20,Hamilton Beach,"March 5, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,5,"This is a wonderful coffee maker! It's the easiest to set the time, and to program the time you want it to start brewing. The little green light will let you know when the auto-program is on. All you need to do is add the right amount of water, a filter, and your favorite coffee.  This unit uses #4 cone filters. Some might see this as a drawback. I see it as a plus. I've tried coffeemakers that use basket filters(which cost less than cone). Sometimes, the sides of the basket filter would tip over during brewing. This usually resulted in the grounds and water overflowing onto the coffee pot and the hot-plate. I don't have this happen with cone filters. I like the auto-pause feature. This allows you to pour a cup of coffee before the brewing cycle is finished. This pot will automatically shut off in two hours, which is another feature I really like. If you are not going to use all the coffee you brew within 30 minutes or so, it's best to pour the finished coffee into a thermal pot. I also recommend you let the pot cool before washing, and wash it using a sponge or cloth-nothing that could score the insides and cause it to crack later.",Have Your Coffee Waiting for You,Walmart,166
21,Hamilton Beach,"February 28, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,5,This Hamilton Beach programmable coffee pot has all the same features as coffee makers 2 or 3 times the price. The buttons are easy to head and to be able to set the coffee pot to be ready for you when you waken is a huge plus. The reservoir is very accessible with one finger so you can be holding the pot of water in the other hand. There is a swing arm you slide to the side to place the coffee in the basket. My only comment is this machine does not come with a sample package of #4 filter papers so you will have to go buy some of them before you can use it. It would be very helpful if a few were enclosed in the box for the consumer. I happen to have a bunch of them on hand so I was able to use it right away. It makes a very good up of coffee no matter what kind of coffee you use. The carafe is made of glass so you have to be careful not to bump it but it does keep the coffee hot for a long time and it doesn't taste burnt as it sometimes does in a metal carafe. I highly recommend this Hamilton Beach coffee put maker to all coffee drinkers,Very sleek looking coffee maker,Walmart,98
22,Hamilton Beach,"March 9, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,5,"We really like the way the coffee comes out of our Hamilton Beach 12 cup programmable coffee maker. We had to adjust the amount of coffee grounds that we added. Both the package of the coffee and the pot directions said to put in quite a lot but we adjusted that to our taste and it is perfect. We bought the Community Coffee-medium roast Breakfast Blend at Walmart and found it to be delicious. The directions are very easy to understand. We programmed the machine to turn on at a certain time in the morning so that the coffee is ready when we are. We only make a small amount of coffee each day since there is just 2 of us, but it does a wonderful job of that. I fill it to the 4 cup mark and it makes 2 nice sized mugs. I bought the cone shaped coffee filters that they recommended. The only improvement that I can see for this coffee maker is getting the water for the coffee to come out a little hotter as we need to put our mug in the microwave for a few seconds , probably due to the amount of creamer that we put in. If you unplug the machine at some time you do need to reset the time and the timer again.",Great coffee maker,Walmart,49
23,Hamilton Beach,"March 12, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,5,"I received this product from the Spark reviewer program. Our other coffee maker would gain hours of time during the week and would require adjustment several times during the week. This coffee maker requires #4 cone filters, which were available at our local store. This is a tall and slender style coffee maker. The carafe has a large handle that my hand fit into easily when pouring coffee. The water reservoir has clearly marked lines that are easy visible. The clock and controls are on the base of the maker, the clock is angled slightly making it easy to read, I would like a backlight on it. The clock has keep accurate time for the last two weeks. Programming is very easy and straight forward. Five buttons and two indicators on the face plate. The coffee was not bitter, just smooth tasting for any of the roasts that we tried. The only complaint that we have on the coffee maker is that the carafe can be a little hard to get in and out of the maker. This may change over time with age and use. It's not a deal breaker for us, but could be aggravating to someone else. I can now enjoy coffee in the morning without having to get up earlier and make it. Overall a good coffee maker without a lot of bells and whistles.","No frills, just coffee",Walmart,38
24,Hamilton Beach,"March 2, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,4,"As of March 2, 2016 I received a black Hamilton Beach 12-cup coffeemaker. To my surprise the shipment was quite expeditious, kudos to the shipping department. It comes equipped with a bilingual manual. It does have a ""burn"" warning as a potential household threat, therefore I recommend reading the fine print before operating this product. The unit does not have a permanent filter like my previous coffeemaker, so you will need to purchase cone shaped filters, depending on the model, prior to purchase. Unfortunately I couldn't use it immediately out of the box for this very reason. It is programmable and consumers can pause the brewing process to pour a cup of coffee before it is completely brewed. It has a transparent water reservoir to make it easier to manage the water as you fill it. Above the filter basket is a lever used to secure the filter and filter basket in place, you slide it from the right to release it and to the left to secure it. This particular model is quaint, adorable, and it doesn't take up too much space, which is perfect for small apartments. So far, the only primary disadvantage is the lack of a permanent filter, other than that this product meets my expectation",Good product,Walmart,38
25,Hamilton Beach,"February 28, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,5,"I am a coffee pot enthusiast; I must have 3 or 4 coffee pots in my house at the present time. My thing with coffee pots, I am very critical; and the reason is I have had coffee pots that leak; steam up the clock, the timer resets itself, etc.  So we have the Hamilton Beach – I love Hamilton Beach and have had their coffee pots in the past. Currently I am using a Mr. Coffee, which I like.  The pluses:  • it makes 12 cups of coffee, • it has a wide area to pour in water, • the coffee pot and maker are compact,  • it is very easy to set the clock and program the timer, • it shuts off after 2 hours,  • and keeps the coffee hot, • it has the number of cups on both sides of the pot,  • the coffee filter fits tight in the maker,  • It is also smart looking.  The cons:  • when opening the top to add the water you will notice the top seems very loose like it could come off in a moment's notice, • The clock doesn't light up. Yes I would recommend this coffee maker, it works great, I have used it three times already, and I literally cannot find anything that would dissuade me at this point and time. Definitely would recommend this coffee maker to anyone.",Small and Compact,Walmart,34
26,Hamilton Beach,"March 23, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,4,"This Hamilton Beach coffee maker is a nice addition in the kitchen. I read a few reviews on this coffee maker and it seems that with the control panel on the bottom was a problem for some people. I think they are saying it might stop working if coffee gets in there? Ok I own a coffee maker with the control panel on top and if you think about it, the steam goes upwards into the control panel every time it is used, not to mention the over flow, so therefore the control panel on top, coffee makers will always have moisture in it. I have used the Hamilton coffee maker everyday for the last 2 weeks and not once has the control panel gotten wet. The Hamilton coffee maker has only 5 buttons, 1 hour, 1 minute these set the time of day and time in which to start the maker, 1 program button 1 on/off button and 1 auto. The instructions are very, very easy to understand and very complete. (may I note: the other coffee maker I have has 8 buttons and zero instructions, nearly impossible to use without making a complete mess). The Hamilton Beach Programmable coffee maker uses a 4"" cone filter which is not available in all stores, which is my reason for 4 stars.

I used to have a Mr. coffee, coffee maker but my husband bumped it and it fell and after that it never worked right again. I also did not like how the programmer part worked or not. Anyway when I got this Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker I was eager to try it out, so I cleaned it like you should and set it all up to brew a pot of coffee the next afternoon, so I set the timer for 12:30 in the afternoon so when I got home from work I would have a pot of coffee ready to enjoy. It also comes with a 2 hour automatic shut off built in, I wish there was a way to turn off the automatic shut off control so you do not have to keep track of the two hours and have to turn it back on. It is great if you forget to turn it off, it will automatically do it for you. It uses a cone shaped filter size number 4. When you put it in the machine you have to make sure you push it down on the filter basket so it is properly seated in the coffee maker, also make sure you align the tab correctly and gently press down on the basket. Drippy Carafes? Just like all coffee makers the Hamilton Beach 12-cup Programmable Coffee Maker if you pour it to fast it will drop out of the side of the Carafe, so just pour it slow and easy and no problem, otherwise you will have a mess to clean-up.

28,Hamilton Beach,"March 4, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,5,"I received this Hamilton Beach Black 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker through the Walmart Spark Reviewer Program free for doing a review of the product. The black plastic exterior is a bold addition to any kitchen and looks sharp on the counter. It has a digital clock for convenience. I like that the clock is at the bottom so that steam does not damage it. It is programmable, so you can choose when brewing begins, hours in advance. The auto pause and serve feature allows you to grab a cup of coffee while it is still brewing. The warming mode keeps your coffee hot and fresh. I like the two hour automatic shut off because it prevents problems from leaving it on all day. The non-stick warmer plate prevents burnt on spills and resists messy coffee buildup. The black color does not show coffee stains easily, like white ones do, and it easily wipes clean. I love the large, easy to see water level indicator that allows you to easily adjust the strength and size of each batch. It has a cone-shaped filter basket for great-tasting coffee uses a #4 cone shaped coffee filter.

30,Hamilton Beach,"March 11, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,5,"The Hamilton Beach 12 cup programmable coffee maker is excellent for anyone who needs to have their coffee at a certain time because it allows you to pre-set your time that you want to have that cup of coffee. I found that it works really well for cups from 4 – 12. I did try just 2 cups and it was okay but I recommend a minimum of 4 cups+. I like the big numbers that are on the side of the filler as well as on the Carafe. By following the instructions for programming the Hamilton Beach coffee maker, you will find it to be very easy to do. Before setting the timer make sure that you set the clock on the Hamilton Beach to the correct time so that when you do set the timer it will go off at the correct time that you wish it to start brewing that/those cup(s) of coffee. Make sure that you pick up some cone shaped coffee filters (Not provided) for your Hamilton Beach coffee maker.  If you are a first time coffee drinker or this is your first time owning a coffee maker, here are some tips. Take the Carafe and fill it to the number of cups of coffee you wish to brew. Open the top of the lid on the Hamilton Beach coffee maker, the water into the filler basket. Place your cone shaped filter into the filter basket. Depending on either how strong and the number of cups of coffee you are brewing (I used 1 teaspoon for every cup of coffee that I planned to make). **I also liked the fact that you can pour yourself a cup in-between the brewing process, but don't take more than 20 seconds it is design for you to quickly pour and replace. Make sure when you replace it that when it starts to pour the coffee into the carafe** Enjoy your New Hamilton Beach 12-cup programmable coffee maker!",Great Coffee Maker,Walmart,2
31,Hamilton Beach,"March 12, 2016",Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker | Model# 49465R,21646036,5,"My husband is very particular about his coffee. He is retired and an early riser and starts his day with a cup of black coffee before even able to string sentences together. He does not like fancy coffees & features he'll never use. I chose this model as I felt he would like model, features and style of this Hamilton Beach, especially the 'Pause & Serve feature. He wants that first cup as soon as the machine has it brewed and will pull out the carafe, pop in his coffee cup. As soon as he pulls out the carafe, the coffee flow stops long enough for him to put in his cup without losing a drop. He puts back in the carafe and the coffee continues brewing as long as it sits on the hot plate. You have to put the carafe back on the hotplate within 20 seconds or the filter basket could over flow.   Just make sure filter is in place so no coffee grounds spill over. The water reservoir and filter are on top of the coffee maker. You have water level on side of machine so you control how much or little coffee you want to start the day. As a Sparks Reviewer for Walmart, I received this Hamilton Beach 12 cup coffee maker to try. My husband does not program his coffee as he rises at different times and dislikes having a pot of coffee warming on the hot plate for over an 1/2 hour, as he feels it would become stronger, more bitter than he likes. However, with dinner or overnight guests, he prefers having the digital clock timer so he can program the timer and coffee will be ready at the right time. It is easy to program and can be set for 20 hrs. The on & off light indication is at the bottom of the hot plate, with the clock and programming buttons. They are large enough for him to read without putting on his glasses. This model does not come with a permanent filter. It does not use the cheaper white basket type filters. The #4 cone filters are more expensive but make a better cup of coffee. I do not find this a problem. I watch grocery flyers for sales and will stock up on the cone filters then. The price difference did concern him but I am a conservative & coupon shopper - so I will watch for sales. This model does not have a brew strength selector. You control the strength by the amount of coffee grounds you put in, usually 1 teaspoon of coffee (more or less to taste) per cup. He knows how he likes his coffee so he did not need the brew strength selector. He did run a pint of plain white, cheap vinegar into the water reservoir before using and will do this monthly to keep it clean & keep coffee from tasting bitter. This is important with hard water or using tap water to keep your coffee pot running properly. It is so easy. Pour in vinegar, run it for 30 seconds. Turn it off, let it set for 30 minutes, turn it back on and let it finish it's cycle. This gives the vinegar a chance to clean the reservoir and filter holder. When the brew cycle is done, turn off. Pour in 1 cup water into reservoir and turn on again. Do this twice to clean out any vinegar and residue.  A trick for washing the carafe without having to use dish soap after using. Rinse carafe in clean water, dump out. Add ice cubes to about half full and shake. It will clean pot without leaving any soapy taste. You can also wash both carafe & filter in the TOP rack of your dish washer too.  Overall, I would give this Hamilton Beach Coffeemaker a 10 on a scale of 1-10. If you don't need a machine with a ton of bells & whistles and just want a good cup of coffee...this is the perfect machine. It is well made. We have the black model that fits our kitchen décor.

What a nice surprise. I seem to have a black and silver theme going on in the kitchen, not on purpose mind you, but it does make everything look fancy when everything matches I think. The filter basket holds the cone filters. I thought it was the other kind. This is the first time I have used the cone filters. This coffee maker comes with a programmable clock, two hour auto shut off, water window, set it to brew at a certain time, and auto pause/serve. Honestly, it is all strait forward and very easy to operate. I have had a few coffee makers over the years. Had everything happen from zapping myself to coffee grounds spilling over the basket into the coffee pot, to forgetting to turn the coffee maker off and burning the pot. I am weird in that I like to brew a whole pot of coffee, this one makes 12 cups, and turning it off. Then rewarming the coffee one cup at a time in the microwave through out the day instead of leaving the coffee maker on for long periods of time and getting that film of oil on top of the coffee. I always thought it tastes better that way. But of course a coffee maker can be used for so much more then just coffee. It can be used for making instant cereals to tea. Anyways, it was shipped very quickly! Packaged very well as to make sure nothing broke like the glass coffee pot. The inside of the top part is an open design so that makes it much easier to get your hand in there to clean it or brush if you prefer. I always bought that cleaning solution made just for coffee makers but you can easily clean this by running hot water through it a few times. Perfect designed coffee maker for the every day coffee lover. I would highly recommend this coffee maker to anyone... The attention to the little details is very nice. It has a stylish sleek design that matches many kitchen decors. Above all it makes a really good pot of coffee. Nice and hot. Quick. Reliable. I have had no issues this this coffee maker what so ever. The cone filters seem to work just fine and have not had to much of a hassle keeping the coffee grounds out of the pot of coffee this time... Over all works very well...",Design matches my kitchen,Walmart,2

My soon has different hours then I do and gets up real early for work so we just program it the night before and when hes up and ready so is his coffee. All we had was 4 cup filters when this came they do work but are small .Also comes with a auto pause feature 2 hour shut of which is wonderful since I tend to be forgetful some times. This does use a 4"" filter but they are coned, Also has a cord storage so you can tuck that excess away . And I like that it has a Nonstick keep hot plate anything I hate is the nasty look of the old hotplate I never could seem to get that clean this one just wipes off clean.

I also like the fact that I can prepare the coffee at night before I go to bed and it is ready when I wake up in the morning. Actually, I do not even need an alarm clock anymore. The wonderful aroma of the coffee wakes me up. Now for the flavor. Wow! The coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee and keeps it warm. I thought making one cup at a time was the best for me, but this makes much better tasting coffee. I am also a tea drinker. There is nothing like a good cup of hot tea for relaxing.

The clock is programmable and the timer allows you to wake up to hot, fresh and great-tasting coffee, and the two-hour automatic shutoff ensures that you will not leave your coffeemaker on all day. It also has a pause-and-serve feature that allows you to pour a cup of coffee from the pot while the coffee is still brewing. Setup of the clock and to program to auto brew at a preset time is very easy! There is a green light that illuminates to show that the timer is set which is super nice.

There is a max line on the water reservoir. With three uses of the smallest cup option (6-8 ounces), a bright blue light indicated to add water.

I'll start by saying that I previously had 2 coffee makers, one for single servings and one for multiple servings, and it's only my husband and I that drink coffee at home. But this Keurig is amazing for single serving and the best part is that it holds up to 36 Oz so I don't have to keep adding water like with any other single serving coffee maker when only my husband and I are going to drink coffee.

The drip tray insert (which can hold up to 6oz overflow) is a smart design allowing you to use a normal cup or remove to accommodate travel mugs up to 7in tall!  - I love the 36 oz. removable water reservoir as it allows you to brew multiple cups before refilling and the *Add Water* indicator is a huge plus!

The only part at all that I can say anything remotely negative about is that the machine while brewing is a little noisier than I expected. It is not a bother, just something I noticed. It is so quick to brew a cup that the noise is brief. My husband and I drink only decaf coffee and have found there are not a lot of flavors to chose from in our area. The machine comes with coffee pods in the box and our friends love the donut shop flavor that comes with it. They said it is very mellow and flavorful at the same time! I would definitely recommend this product as easy to use, looks good on your counter, lots of K-Pod flavors to chose from and have had zero issues with it.",Keurig K is simple and perfect,Walmart,4

But I also like being able to make a pot of a good new coffee whether I purchased it or received it as a gift.  The full pot coffee maker has all of the functions I have used on other stand-alone coffee makers like the timer and keep-warm cycle after brewing.  This seems like a quality product with quality construction and I like that each side has its own water reservoir.  The footprint is also nice as having both coffee makers in this single device takes up much less counter space that my two separate devices. I also like the clean simple design of the front of the coffeemaker.  I think most people would enjoy having both coffeemaker capabilities in a single product.

81,Hamilton Beach,"January 16, 2019",Hamilton beach flexbrew 2-way coffee maker | model# 49954,511290968,5,"I thought I was a Keurig lifer. However recently I started missing the option to set my brew for the morning when I woke up and having a big pot to last me in the morning on the weekends. I know Keurig offers the Carafe but it honestly doesnt hold that much. So fast fwd,  I purchased this one after extensive research. As a person who loves coffee and tea and not as a online reviewer asked to review these products because I got them for free, I am completely satisfied with my purchase. So much that I am selling my Keurig and will never look back. The pod to brew your own coffee on the single serve side is nice and roomy so I dont struggle to empty the spent grinds. The pot holds so much coffee that I cant possibly drink that much so I brew half a pot. At first it's going to seem like the single serve side takes a long time to brew, however it's just sucking up the water for the first time and really there is no difference between Keurigs time and this ones time. I even brewed both at the same time to make sure. I love having hot coffee when I wake up and not having to make a cup while sleepy eyed and wait for it. It is bulkier than I'm used to but to be honest the 2 in one machine makes up for its gerth. I will never go back and that's the honest truth. Plus Keurig can cause sinus issues because it grows bacteria in places the cleaning solution and you cannot reach. Some of you might be reading this to see if you can make a single serve cup while brewing a pot and the answer is no. However you can stop brewing, make a single serve cup on that side, then resume brewing the pot. It really is a win win.",Thought I was Keurig for life,Walmart,0
82,Hamilton Beach,"September 20, 2018",Hamilton beach flexbrew 2-way coffee maker | model# 49954,511290968,5,"I got the BeachFlexBrew Coffe Maker and I love it. The function buttons are large and easy to read, which is a big plus for my eyes. I don't need my glasses to see which button I need to push to start a pot of coffee. Another feature I like is the clock and settings screen. It is illuminated and is easy to see the time and settings during the day and at night and the details are large enough to see the time and settings. The next great feature is the ability to make a full pot or by the single cup. It comes with an interchangeable filter, which, one is for making a single cup with just ground coffee and the other is for making a single cup using pods. The fill basket to set the cup on is removable to set a standard travel mug under the brewer to make a larger cup. I've also used a .16 oz. mug to make a bigger cup of coffee. You can set the timer for automatic pot brewing. The best feature of them all for me is the ability to set the strength for bold or normal. The bold setting makes a cup of coffee that tastes great and I've tried many other brands of coffee makers with the same feature but I never noticed the difference in the taste. This is one of the best coffee makers I've ever owned and I plan on using it until it no longer works and then I will go purchase another one.

83,Hamilton Beach,"September 18, 2018",Hamilton beach flexbrew 2-way coffee maker | model# 49954,511290968,5,"This review details the features and use of the Hamilton Beach, Model 49976, Series B1981CE 2-Way FlexBrew Coffee Maker, of which I have attached some images. I suspect that, like me, many people have a cabinet full of coffee makers that have accumulated as a consequence of one's search for a quality and conveniently brewed cup of coffee. Of secondary importance to me is the ease of cleaning and maintaining a coffee maker such that it performs as designed and without messy failures. I drink Italian (dark) roast espresso coffee. In my experience, fine-grind coffees challenge coffee makers because, due to the density of the grounds, they impede the flow of water. As a result, whether one uses reusable stainless steel (not as bad) or paper (terrible) filters, every coffee maker I have used with fine-grind espresso roast coffee has often caused the filter to overflow. Coffee makers anticipate this phenomenon by including drain holes toward the top of the brew basket. The problem is, often coffee grounds will be carried with the overflowing water and plug the outlet into the carafe. Then what: the brew basket fills with water and overflows onto one's countertop. So much for the joy of one's morning coffee. On those occasions when the brew basket does not become plugged and overflow, one is, nevertheless, left with partially brewed coffee and a brew basket full of coffee grounds necessitating removal of the brew basket and an additional cleaning step. Following Hamilton Beach's directions, I brew my carafe with an 8-12 cup paper basket filter in the brew basket. (Off hand, I would anticipate that a reusable stainless-steel filter would suffice.) It takes thirteen minutes and forty seconds for a 12-cup carafe to brew – a bit long I thought, but not a pragmatic consideration, which I will discuss, following. The brewed coffee is exceptional. Upon inspection, I find that the coffee oils stain the paper filter to a point between one-half and one-third of the way from the top of the filter. In other words, the slow feed of water to the grounds prevents water accumulation and filter overflow and permits full brewing of the coffee. Thus, clean-up is simple: remove the brew basket, dispose of the filter and a quick swish with a dishcloth and rinse: I'm done. The built-in warmer will keep the carafe warm for two hours after the brewing cycle begins. I was interested in a two-way system because there are those occasions when I want a single or quickly brewed cup/mug of coffee. For example, waiting almost fourteen minutes for a full pot of coffee first thing in the morning can be agonizing for a coffee hound. The single serve side produces a 14-ounce (maximum) cup/mug of coffee in two minutes and forty seconds, less, if less water is used. As in the case of the carafe-side, the brew basket is not going to overflow. While the mug is brewing, I load the carafe side and, as soon as the single-side has finished brewing (one cannot brew both sides simultaneously), I start the carafe-side brewing.  As in the case of the carafe side, the single-side yields a quality and conveniently brewed cup of coffee. In all cases on both sides, the 2-way FlexBrew expresses all of the water in their respective reservoirs. Thus, using the carafe or single-side GROUND method, apart from “Bold” and “Regular” settings, one can readily adjust the coffee boldness by adjusting either the coffee or water volume. When using the sealed pods, one selects the “Regular” or “Bold” settings and, in addition, boldness can be further  tweaked by varying the volume of water (10 oz. being the recommended maximum).  Single-side POD operation is simple: insert pod into the pod holder, close the lid, select regular or bold, add the desired amount of water to the reservoir, and start brewing. For single-side GROUND brewing, the process is identical except that one uses the included brew basket instead of the pod holder. If desired, one can also add a #1 paper filter in the brew basket. Clean-up is simple: remove the pod holder or brew basket, if used flush out brew basket grounds, a quick wipe with a dish cloth, and rinse. Both pods and brew basket are inserted into a “funnel” that is also readily removed and rinsed off. The 2-Way FlexBrew has a clock and is programmable to brew on demand. Its 2.5” x 3.5” screen clearly shows (soft blue digital characters) the clock, selected brewing options, and brewing progress (brewing or stand-by mode). The screen is not a touch screen; options are selected by large buttons (which I prefer) adjacent to the screen. Considering available counter space: the dimensions at their widest point are: 12-1/8” wide, 12-1/4” deep, 14-1/4” high with carafe reservoir lid closed, and 21-1/4” high with carafe reservoir lid open.     The 2-Way FlexBrew satisfies my desires using my preferred coffee: both sides produce an excellent cup of coffee – a quick cup if I am impatient, a carafe to get me through the day; as far as I have determined, there is no possibility of overflow into the carafe or cup thus yielding fully brewed coffee and averting a countertop mess; clean-up is fast and easy; if necessary, the pod needle assembly is easily and quickly removed with a simple twist for cleaning; and all of the metal and plastic parts are substantial and, therefore, durable without question. The 2-Way FlexBrew satisfies all of my requirements and I recommend it without reservations.

100,Ninja,"September 22, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"First, I want to be clear that the only coffee pots that I've ever had have all been simple with maybe the added feature of being able to program a timer. So, after reading my instruction manual I commenced to washing the carafe and other components as instructed, set the time (so simple) added a filter and coffee using the included scoop which I must say is very handy and tucked right onto the side of the machine. I selected the amount of coffee for the machine to make, added the appropriate amount of water to the reservoir pushed the power button, (there are multiple choices for your comfort level, cup, XL cup, 1/2 carafe, full carafe and even a travel mug option) and then chose how I wanted my coffee to taste (I chose classic for starters) First pot was a little strong so I reduced the coffee for the next pot and it was perfect! I had never had frothed milk in coffee before until this machine. My husband ventured for this and made us each a cup of coffee with frothed milk using the built in frother (again, tucked neatly on the side of the machine until ready for use, see picture below) We are still experimenting with Ninja Coffee bar and are finding unending ways to mix and blend coffees plus using the enclosed recipes that came with the machine. This machine is very easy to use, easy to clean, easy to set up and is very attractive on my counter top.

There are so many choices on how to make your coffee. We have been using the brew a pot method. The removable water reservoir is very easy to take off the machine and fill up. All the moving parts move with easy and in a really modern way. I love that you have stop the drip so you can grab a quick cup of coffee before it fills the pot all the way up because some mornings you just can't wait. When you remove the pot there is a pull down lever so you can just fill a cup up at a time. The frothier is a fun device to have. The machine is very easy to use everything lights up so you can see and read the screen. The coffee stays hot for a very long time. The filter is easy to access and fill and remove after use.

102,Ninja,"October 4, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"I am in-love with this coffee bar! I've wanted one since I saw the first infomercial ages ago. It really does live up to the hype.  It's super-simple to un-box, set-up, use, and to clean. In the box: Fully assembled Coffee-bar, Manual, Quick start guide, Recipe book, Cleaning guide, attached milk frother, attachable double-end measure spoon with amounts per brew molded into handle, Glass Carafe, Cone#4 filters and all kinds of stickers on brewer to get you quickly acquainted.  Everything about it feels high-quality. It reminds me of commercial/business type machines a little bit. It's a bit on the larger side as far as coffee makers go but not so big that it makes an imposition in my tiny kitchen. It is tall and has a small amount of steam released from the top during use. The steam isn't so much that it would damage standard height cabinets above it. This may be something to consider if you plan on using it where there might be a low overhead.  The recipe book is well written and contains details about all the types of brews, sizes etc. It has 10 recipes, only 3 are cold brews. I personally think they could of included way more but the ones they do have can be adaptable to taste. I was really impressed that my first attempts at making fancy drinks were relatively successful. The recipes are easy to follow and don't require any expertise.   Overall, I'm very happy with my coffee bar. My only kinda-cons are that my specific model didn't come with a reusable filter and the recipe book could be bigger. I definitely recommend!",LOVE!,Walmart,6
103,Ninja,"September 13, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"I am very impressed by the Ninja Coffee Bar. It's so much better than the ones that make you buy the little (and expensive) coffee pods. You use your own coffee and cone filters.   The user manual that comes with it gives you step by step instructions for brewing the coffee you want. It has all the bells and whistles that the other brands have and more. It even tells you how to get hotter coffee.  Any questions are answered in the manual. In fact, by the time I had washed the components and finished the priming, I was pretty familiar with the system. It also comes with a recipe book filled with recipes and how to's for several different coffee styles. It's easy to understand so you get the speciality coffee you want.  A really nice feature is the frother that comes attached. It is easily removed for cleaning and swings out of sight after use. It's almost automatic. You just put your prepared cup under it and push the top. It spins and froths the liquid. It also comes with a 2 ended scoop which attaches to the side of the machine so it doesn't get lost. There is a small scoop on one end and a large scoop on the other.  The hardest part of the whole procedure was figuring how much coffee to use! They give you amounts, but it's really up to you how strong you want it.  So far, I've made several classics, which is standard coffee and a few lattes. I can't wait to try all the recipes in the book. I love cappuccino and am going to try that next.  I think, for the money, you can't beat this coffee bar. I would recommend it in a heartbeat.",Lookout Coffee Houses,Walmart,6
104,Ninja,"October 1, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"I only have positive things to say about this multifunctional Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System. To begin, it is packaged well, very securely. The unit does not move around in the box nor any of its pieces. Each piece was wrapped securely. The box is attractive and contains useful product information. The box contained an easy to follow guide with quick setup instructions, an owners manual, including registration instructions with a coupon for a gift. I immediately went online to register my product and received a full bottle cleaning solution to run the clean cycles when needed. I have been using my machine for a month and have not had to run a clean cycle yet. The indicator light will illuminate when a clean cycle is needed. I really like that you can get any spare replacement part on the Ninja website. No need to worry if you break the sturdy glass Carafe, you can easily replace it at Ninja.com. Before using the unit I read all of the instructions, which I highly recommend to anyone. I ran the recommended 2 water carafe cycles and the unit was ready to go. I like that it came with complimentary filters. The unit had clearly marked instruction labels and caution labels that are removed prior to its first use. The frother is excellent. It works like a charm, easy to use. The Ninja Coffee Bar System has a clock however, it does not include seconds. It is suggested to use the frother for 30-45 seconds but there is no way to use the actual unit to time it. Of course I just do an approximation but it would have been better to have a way to time it on the unit. However, after two weeks of use I know what the milk should look like once under the frother and no longer need to time it, therefore, perhaps a timer is not really needed unless I have guests who would like to use it. The frother can be stored behind the unit optimizing counter space. I pull it out to the side of the unit while I use it then tuck it away in the back when I turn off the machine. This is a very attractive, sleek, modern looking appliance. It will certainly compliment any kitchen design. Considering all of the things it does, i.e. possible drink combinations, it is a good size for counter space. And as if that is not enough, it comes with a delicious, easy to follow, recipe book with color pictures of the recipes! For the first time in my life I have made the best tasting lattes, cappuccinos, flavored specialty coffees and ice coffee. I love ice coffee and frappes and have become at expert in my own home. Even the older adults love the frappes. Since I have this machine I have saved so much money! I no longer go to fancy coffee shops. I can make a small cup, XL cup, thermal cup, 1/2 carafe or full carafe. The unit has a useful knob to select the cup size. It also comes with a super convenient two size measuring scoop that neatly is stored on the side of the unit. That was a brilliant idea. You can get a delicious hot cup or cold coffee within 2 minutes; now that is record time. This Ninja Coffee Bar System does it all! I love this machine and highly recommend it. It is well worth the investment and with the holidays approaching, this is a great gift for family and friends or a special boss, or teacher who deserves a good gift. Even a few coworkers can chip in to give it as a gift. I am very pleased and my guests also agree that this Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System is worthy of praise and recommendation.",Best coffee bar system on the market,Walmart,5

106,Ninja,"September 14, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"I LOVE this coffeemaker and would give it 10 stars if I could – with its diverse and user-friendly features, you can create many of the expensive coffee shop drinks at home, so if you're a “coffeeholic,” this coffeemaker will pay for itself in no time. It was easily set up; a simple washing of the glass carafe and filter holder, plus two cycles of plain water, and it was ready to go. It uses regular #4 paper filters or a permanent screen-type filter (User tip: Even though the manual implies that a permanent filter was included, it was not). The user manual and quick start guide were detailed and easy to follow – recommended review prior to proceeding. Choose the type of container for the desired amount of coffee – whether a regular-sized or large cup or mug, a travel-sized or extra-large tumbler, a half carafe or full carafe, and fill the water reservoir to the indicated line, placing back on the machine (User tip: If reservoir is filled to the “max fill” line, make sure to hold it level, without tilting, when returning it to the machine or it will spill). Place the container under the spout, and make sure the drip stop lever is to the open position (to the right). Use the included double-ended “smart scoop” to measure the desired amount of ground coffee into the filter, swing the filter holder back into place, touch the Power button, rotate the dial until the appropriate container light comes on, touch the button for the strength/richness of the desired brew, and shortly you will have a steaming cup or pot of coffee, customized to your taste! If you're making a cappucino or latte with the addition of steamed milk, there is a built-in frother that swings out from behind the machine. Simply pour hot or cold milk into a cup or small pitcher, hold under the frother, and press the button. If using the glass carafe, the warmer will come on automatically and will stay heated until the power is turned off. (User tip: The warmer light will stay on for a few minutes, even after the power is turned off, until the warmer cools enough so it is safe to the touch. This was not clearly explained in the manual.)  The next morning, I used the “over ice” setting and, with a little milk and vanilla syrup, made delicious iced coffee. (User tip: Freeze leftover coffee in an ice tray or small plastic cup to make coffee ice cubes, which will not dilute your drink.) There is also an automatic cleaning cycle that eliminates the need for periodically running vinegar through the system to eliminate mineral/scale buildup.  I think that the only improvement that could be made on this coffeemaker would be a built-in grinder for roasted whole beans. Because the manufacturer recommends that fine (espresso) grind not be used since it would cause the water to overflow, the coffeemaker does just fine with a medium grind, so incorporating a grinder with a single grind-size setting would be simple and an excellent user convenience.

107,Ninja,"September 17, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,4,"We love coffee...and we have tried just about any type of coffee maker. Some were too big, too small, too complex or just did not deliver a hot enough cup. The Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System is neither too big (see pic comparing size with icoffee, just a bit wider and taller) nor too complex since it has easy to use feature selection knob and buttons with clear labeling. The main features are: - Sizes are preset, just turn knob from single cup to full carafe and several sizes in-between - Holder for grounds is easy to clean and swivels out and locks in place very easily, no fumbling in the basket because of the big handle on side (see pic) - Hot and flavorful coffee - Carafe is easy to pour - Warming plate time is adjustable and it senses when a carafe is placed on it and then comes on automatically, which is pretty neat - Includes milk frother and measuring spoon attached to side - Easy fill and remove water reservoir that is clearly marked - When placed on counter in middle of room, carafe is accessible from both sides - Makes regular coffee or a stronger brew  Husband and I like the clean lines of the coffee bar, and it makes a good cup of coffee. So why only four stars?  - The touted single cup filter was not included, but I bought it separately on ebay. In the meantime I brewed a large single cup using a regular filter and there was some splashing. - Takes a bit longer to go from cold to hot than our dedicated single cup machine and the fold-out holder for the small single cup has a bit of a flimsy feel to it. - I am getting older and the markings could be a bit bigger for my aging eyes - Longer single cup prepping time: It might not be fair to compare a dedicated single cup machine to the Ninja Coffee Bar, but my one major gripe is that my husband makes his full pot (which he likes) and then I come with my single cup and a different type of coffee and that means taking off the carafe, cleaning out the filter, pouring more water in the reservoir, and resetting the size, and then putting his pot back on after I am done, but maybe I can beat him to the machine in the mornings...",Solid four-star performance,Walmart,4
108,Ninja,"September 28, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"I'm instantly impressed by the Ninja Coffee Bar's ergonomics and plentiful features. It easily fits under my upper cabinets. I had to pull my previous machine out to fill the water reservoir or brew basket, but with the Ninja, I can now lift the reservoir off the machine and slide the brew basket open without moving the whole thing! One of my favorite features- the spoon! It might seem little, but I love that Ninja embossed a guide for # of scoops per type of brew on the spoon and that it can be stored right on the side of the machine! There's a variety of brew choices for all preferences: standard classic, rich so can add cream and not lose coffee's flavor, cafe forte is full-bodied that tastes great black, specialty is an ultra-rich concentrate, and over Ice brews cooler to go into a cup of ice without over-watering it down. Pretty cool! From my testing so far, all of the brews live up to their names.  Some of the brews only brew in one size. E.g. cafe forte is always 8oz. But overall the flexibility in brew sizes is great- cup, XL cup, travel, XL travel, half carafe, carafe.  When you take this coffee bar out of the box, there's a sticker over the size dial that actually tells you the oz. of each size. When you peel it off, the machine only has icons and names (which light up to indicate which is chosen). I wish the oz. were on the machine too. But you can reference the Quick Start Guide. I really like that both the carafe and single-serve cups fit in the same brew space, unlike my previous 2-way flex brew machine that had two separate brewing areas, therefore was much larger.  The drip stop is another great little feature to keep from making a mess on the hot plate if you want your coffee right away. Overall I'm really impressed with the Ninja Coffee Bar so far, and hope that continues as I put each and every feature to the test!","Smart, versatile gourmet coffee for one or many",Walmart,3
109,Ninja,"September 27, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"I've been using my new Ninja Coffee Bar for about 6 days now. I LOVE it. The coffee tastes so much better. The bar is so easy to use, everything you would need to know is right on the front of the bar. When using the bar all you have to do is look on the front of it to know exactly what to do for how much you want to make, what strong you want it to be and the coffee scoop that conveniently has it's own niche on the side of the bar lets you see exactly how much coffee to use. The water reservoir just lifts on and sits back on with not having to click back in, it just sits right in place. The frother on the side whips up your the creamer/milk so easily and just takes a turn to remove for cleaning and a turn to replace it. This machine is just so easy to use. It's just an awesome coffee maker. The only con I find is that the pamphlet that comes with it shows that it has a mesh reusable filter and it does not, you will need to buy filters because it's a regular plastic brew basket. I wish it did have the mesh reusable filter because that would be so convenient. The company needs to insert a pamphlet that applies to the model in box.

110,Ninja,"September 10, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"For me there is nothing better than the taste of coffee. I love every coffee drink known to man and the Ninja coffee bar system pretty much makes every coffee drink known to man. I am pretty sure coffee shops are not going to like the competition they are going to get with this invention being in people's homes where they can enjoy the very same professional coffee drinks right in their own homes at a fraction of the cost. And this machine DOES make the very same drinks that taste every bit as good! You can make a single cup of pod free coffee for yourself using one coffee cup or you can make 10 cups with the glass carafe that comes with it. It has an amazing hot and cold frother on the side of it that transforms hot or cold milk into silky froth in seconds. And what makes the coffee flavor from this machine so much better than other coffee machines is it's patented thermal flavor extraction. Many variables go into brewing the perfect cup of coffee, temperature, pre-infusion and saturation. And this machine's thermal flavor extraction technology automatically controls all of that for us. Water is heated to the exact temperature for the particular coffee drink you choose to make. Pre infusion-grounds are evenly saturated then given time to “bloom”. Then grounds are saturated a second time for an even constant extraction. Brew size choice options on it are one cup, travel mug, X-large single cup, multi serve, half or full carafe. Classic brew is smooth rich balanced flavor, rich brew is richer than classic with more intense flavor that really stands up to extra milk, cream or flavoring. Over ice brew-designed to brew fresh and hot over ice cold coffee drink that is never watered down. And the Ninja exclusive cafe forte brew which is a full bodied cup of coffee that amplifies your coffee's unique nuances down to the last sip. And a nice little coffee drink recipe book comes with this unit too. It also has a removable water reservoir that makes it easier to clean, a program delay brew option, drip stop, and even a clean cycle feature. The glass carafe that comes with it is very nice. Has a brew through lid which keeps the coffee taste good down to the last cup in the carafe. My husband and I are in coffee heaven with this thing. I've not had time to try every single coffee drink in the recipe book but I plan to eventually get to every one of them. We can even make carmel macchiatos! My favorite! I have only just got this machine so I can't attest to how long it will last but as of right now its probably my most favorite thing in my kitchen. I'm having a blast with it! It makes the best flavored cup of coffee I've ever tasted from a home brewing machine. Home brewing systems that make coffee specialty drinks like this that taste this good are really expensive.

I only use to make classic coffee for right now. It is very simple to use even though at first glance it does have a lot buttons but once you check out it is very simple to use. The coffee taste is great because I always use rich brew setting. It comes with booklet that contains 10 coffee house style recipes. It is very clever idea of integrated frother that swings back inside when not in use, but it would be even better if can heat up milk instead of using microwave first (according to directions from their booklet). Preparing brand new coffee maker is procedure that requires you run the clean cycle two times before you can use it. One hour to run the water through, and about 8 to 10 minutes at least to flush the system and then again repeat same thing as calling priming Ninja Bar system. After that you are set to use. Ninja Coffee Bar system is very tall machine about 15 inches in height so make sure you have enough room for this unit especially because at top of coffee maker there are steam holes that need even more room to release extremely hot air.

112,Ninja,"October 3, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,1,"I have several Shark-Ninja products at home. I have never been disappointed in how they work, or how they look, until now. I've had this ""Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System CF090"" for several weeks now, and have only just now been able to get it to work. I even had to call customer service to get some idea if it was my fault, that perhaps I wasn't doing something correctly. I followed all the directions to set it up, just like I always do with a new and unfamiliar appliance or tool.  After following all the added suggestions of the person at customer service, I finally put it through a cleaning cycle, as he suggested. That only added to my disgust with this product, as this was a brand new out of the box appliance. Why should I have to put it through an intense cleaning cycle before I could get it to work properly? It's supposed to know how much water to draw from it's reservoir, after you choose size and type of brewing you want to match with the mug or carafe you are using. Nope! No matter how I set it, it wanted to draw all the water out.  It's finally working, although I don't trust it enough to walk away while it's brewing, only to come back and find coffee all over the kitchen! About the only part of this machine I do like is the frother. However, I can't see spending $$ just for a fancy frother. The other thing is that it is labor intensive to clean.

Ninja has really thought of everything you would want in a coffee and specialty drink machine. There are so many great features on this machine that I apologize if I miss a few. First is the appearance. It's black and chrome with a very sleek design. There is a hidden frother (more about that later), and an attached scoop on the side so you'll never misplace your coffee scooper again.  There is a removable water reservoir which makes filling it much easier than trying to pour water in the top. There is a large glass carafe that you can designate for a half or a full carafe. This machine will also accommodate, a cup of coffee (without pods), an XL cup of coffee, a travel mug or specialty drink cup. Just use the dial on the front and pick your pleasure.  Now for the technology. The front panel is equipped with a clock that is easily set and a brew delay or timer so that you can set your coffee to start at any time during the day or night.  Making your coffee or specialty drink is as easy as pushing a button! It's called ""Auto-iQ, one touch intelligence."" Once the machine is on, the front panel lights up and you turn the dial to whatever size cup, travel mug or carafe you want. There is a button for classic or rich brew along with an over ice brew, specialty brew or cafe forte. It's really that easy. One of the great features is what's called, Thermal Flavor Extraction and it works by heating the water to the correct temperature, then pre-infusion where the grounds are lightly and evenly saturated and given time to 'bloom'. And then the grounds are saturated again for an even consistent extraction. Now, that all may sound too technical but this Ninja Coffee Bar has figured it all out for you. You just push a button and sit back. The final two parts of my review are: Number 1. Making a regular cup of coffee. I put my mug on the fold out tray for a one cup selection and the taste was really good. Definitely different from my other coffee maker. Number 2. And this was a very important test which was the frother. It is located in the back of the machine so it's out of the way when not in use. Just pull it towards the side and it's ready to froth both hot and cold milk. I love cappuccino's and for years I have tried to master the art of frothing milk to the correct consistency. This frother is the best I've ever seen. On my very first try, with a very small amount of milk, I had froth that I've never seen before. It whipped it up like it was whipped cream! It was thick and foamy and lasted in my cup for quite a while.

114,Ninja,"September 21, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"I just can't say enough good things about this coffee maker with only a couple small negatives. Never have I gotten excited about a coffee maker until getting this. First of all, it is really sleek and good looking sitting on the countertop. Initially upon reading the instruction booklet I thought it might be a little complicated to use with maybe too many choices but after using for a short time and becoming familiar with it, it's actually really easy. The amount of thought process that went into the design and imbedded programming of it's functionality are way beyond any ordinary coffee pot. It makes FANTASTIC COFFEE regardless of a full pot, single cup, or even a small espresso. I would have liked it to include a permanent screen filter instead of having to use disposable cone filters. The only other negative is it seems to use a little more coffee than about same volume of our old coffee maker which was just the most basic fill with water and push the button type. Other than these 2 minor complaints, this coffee bar is unbeatable to anything we've ever had before including some very popular, well known name brand brewers of various styles. One of the features included is the frother. Nice but not a real important item to us initially but after using several times, it's become one of the things we really like. It works best using a few tablespoons of milk instead of a few ounces just from trial and error. The pot itself is sleek and unusually nice to pour from. Something we would have never acknowledged before using this type of design. When this maker starts brewing, it just doesn't mindlessly purge hot water through it until water used up, it starts to brew, then pauses allowing grinds to saturate and extract before continuing further. Even after it's done brewing, the hotplate doesn't just stay hot, it regulates its own temperature depending on brew type, length of time since brew and automatically adjusts itself so it doesn't burn coffee or bitter it. Even the keep warm / auto off time can be changed to some different choices with a default of 2 hours. The stop drip lever that prevents drippage on hotplate is really nice. I was worried about this feature before we got it being concerned if it was accidentally left in that position when making a new pot it would be a huge mess.

116,Ninja,"September 18, 2017",Ninja Coffee Bar Glass Carafe System (CF090),505042804,5,"Being from south Louisiana this was an appropriate review title. There are so many great benefits about this system. First of all when I think of Ninja, I think Martial Arts. This system is the Black Belt of Coffee makers. It looks amazing right out of the box, fits perfectly on the kitchen counter under the cabinets. You can brew a single cup to a whole carafe. Of course it has all the standard options, like setting it to when you want to wake up to that hot carafe of coffee, but there is so much more. There are 6 brew settings, with 5 custom brews, Classic, Rich, Over Ice, Specialty, and the Ninja Exclusive, ""Café Forte"" which simply means that the color and taste is amplified to the last sip at the bottom of the cup. It comes with a recipe guide, 5 #4 filters to get you started if you use filters, (You do not have to, but I choose to, just my preference, and the filters fit perfectly, just follow the directions. It also has a scooper that fits on the side of the system. It has a built in frother that easily can be put on or taken off, and believe me it works, turning hot or cold milk to a delicious micro foam, and the possibilities are endless on the tastes you can create with it. You also have a cleaning cycle which is an added plus. It's labeled ""Auto IQ"" (One Touch Intelligence). From the water being heated to the right temperature, the grounds being evenly saturated for an even extraction, well the process just creates the most awesome delicious brews, just like a coffee house for a whole lot less money. I've made several of the brews in the recipe guide ""Too Good Toffee Coffee"" and Crème De Caramel"". I have also done a Cappuccino and a couple Lattes. The biggest benefit, My 12 year old son and I spend quality time together on the week-ends making specialty brews He has even tried a cold Iced Vanilla Latte, and loved it. It will be a staple in our home for many years to come. If I could give this system 10 stars I would. I highly recommend it.",CAJUN NINJA APPROVED,Walmart,2

There is a feature to stop the filter from dripping if you want a cup of coffee before the pot is all the way done that is awesome! I am pretty impatient in the morning so it is nice to be able to grab a cup of coffee without making a giant mess. The water reservoir is easy to take off, easy to fill, and easy to clean! The glass carafe also has a locking lid which makes it nice, now I don't have to worry about the lid lifting and water spilling out when I fill the reservoir.

Granted, the brew quality is more a factor of the quality of beans and their grind than the machine itself. Ease of Cleaning The hardest part to clean is the milk frother. You need to take the plastic part off and clean the metallic part of the frother with a damp cloth. Other than that, you detach the porta-filter handle and remove the filter from the handle to clean both. Ease of Use The most tedious part of using this espresso machine is grinding the espresso beans and compacting them into the porta-filter with a tamper. Other than that, you twist the porta-filter in place, fill the reservoir with cold water, screw the reservoir lid on tight, and you're good to go. Design Good design for the cost of the machine.

The size and footprint of the 5 cup seems smaller than the four cup too and takes up less space on the counter top.  The workings are very much like the old four cup model.

One complaint is that you can not turn the warming plate on again once the machine utilizes the automatic 2 hour shut off. NOT true! Simply press the button that you press for either the initial brew start or to start the delay brew. Press it one time, the green light will come on. If you press it twice and the yellow delay light comes on, simply press again to turn machine off (which, by the way, you can do if you drink the coffee sooner than 2 hours), and press again. It will beep and begin the 2 hour countdown again. This machine is so simple and convenient! We purchased the metal permanent basket.  No extra waste simple to clean. Someone complained about how you fill the machine. We use our filtered water from a pitcher, I simply pull the machine close to edge of  counter, and fill. I love the swivel water spout on it and the fact that the lid makes sure that you never have to worry about forgetting to move it over the coffee after filling the basket! I don't know why so many people wrote negative reviews, this machine won't do your taxes, correct your child's homework, or make you a better person, but it sure makes a mighty fine cup of coffee, piping hot and ready the moment I wake in the morning.

181,Hamilton Beach,"November 13, 2018",Hamilton Beach 2 Way Brewer | Model# 49980Z,16503575,5,"I discovered this coffee pot a few months ago while staying at an Air BnB.  My husband loves strong coffee and this one is able to provide a nice strong brew at a very affordable price. We were spending $70-$80 a month on Keurig K-cups, with this the price has dropped to $20 a month for the most expensive brands of ground coffee.  My favorite features: -Bold brew mode (important to my husband who likes it    STRONG) -Automatic brew function to wake to coffee, important because this is kind of slow to brew.   I personally feel that slower is better, it gives the water a chance to really soak up the coffee flavor.   -Single serve side that accommodates my Yeti mug.  Don't expect it to brew as fast a a Keurig, because it takes several times longer.  However, the taste is well worth the wait.  -Option to use pods (but I doubt I will) on the single serve side or just fill the small gold pod (yes, it comes with a gold filter for the single serve side, but I had to buy one for the pot side.  SPECIAL NOTES: Unit does not come with a travel mug, but it is the perfect size for a Yeti mug (mine is about 7” tall).  It can also accommodate a shorter mug by a simple flip of the base on the single serve side. (See my photos) I purchased the Hamilton Beach 8-12 cup permanent gold toned filter to go with this.   At first it appeared to be too small for the coffee pot, because it only goes about 2/3 of the way up.  However, it works, with the filter half way full of coffee it can brew a super strong pot of java without the grounds making a big mess.   LAST NOTE:  I don't taste any plastic.  Just a really darn good cup of coffee.  That's why we were so impressed with this pot that we purchased one the day we returned home from our trip.",Dumped the Keurig for this,Walmart,0

I can live with it, Hamilton Beach has excellent Customer Service and 1 year warranty. I purchased this product the 1st of November 2011. I love/loved it so much that I'd see people in name brand Bath type stores and tell them to check out this coffee maker. It's perfect. I steered 4 people to purchase it, 3 of whom I'd never met! That's how sold I am on it. I love that we can have a full pot of coffee and keep it on the warmer which keeps it really warm. Or, a quick single cup, in my own cup or mug, or the insulated travel mug that comes with it. I just flip the switch to individual, fill that side with water (good for hot water without coffee too#! If I've run out of the Senso type coffee pods, it has this wonderful little screen filter that you put your own scoop of coffee in and wa-la...brew away. So coffee pod or not, I have about a 16 ounce cup of coffee of my own. I love this, love this maker - a multi-tasker like me! ****Now.... I have owned it 6 months next week and I have 1 issue. The large pot warming plate on OUR unit, has the Teflon type coating thas has started flaking off, so my maker looks several years old! It's just my husband and I using it, not abusing it. No harsh abrasives at all. So maybe it's a fluke, just our unit, but today I called Hamilton Beach and it falls under the 1 year warranty. I took photos and emailed to HB. They will replace the whole item but shipping to my rural California area is almost $16 dollars. Well worth it, HOWEVER knowing now? Purchase the Walmart 3-year $6 warranty and play it safe. I hate warranties for little things. Next time I'll reconsider it! Bottomline, save all your documents, sales receipts, etc., in case you need them. Sit back and enjoy this fine machine!

And then I stumbled across this Hamilton Beach Scoop 2 way coffee maker. I read the reviews and decided to go with this one as it would work for our lifestyle. I drink more coffee than my boyfriend so the single side would work during the week for me and the pot side on the weekends for both of us. I am so glad I went this purchase. It is very simple to use and love the fact that you can use the pods or ground coffee on the single serve side. I personally love ground coffee as to pods. It took a few days to get used to measuring coffee again from using the Keurig. But I did and I almost forgot how fresh ground coffee tasted. The machine is also very nice looking in the kitchen. So, from my experiece I would recommend this as to a Keurig if you are undecided. Because sometimes you just want more than one cup of coffee especially when having guests. Not to mention those expensive K-cups. It does take a little extra time to brew on the single serve side but hey, if that's the only negative, I can deal with that. That's why the auto timer is great to use!! Made this purchase a few months ago and have had no problems! On a side note, I bought a coffee bean grinder from cuisinart and love it!

I am 100% satisfied as I tried several brands and several models of brands before getting this one. I like being able to make one cup to carry with me and the versatility of making up to 12 cups. I also learned that 5 oz water is considered 1 cup in a coffee maker and the formula is : 5 oz x's number of cups of water divided by 5, divided by 2, i.e., 8 cups water x's 5 = 40 divided by 5 = 8 divided by 2 = 4 scoops of coffee for water line of 8 cups, and add a little more or less for fine or coarse grind and desired strength.

You fill up your coffee mug with water, put it in the separate water reservoir, put a scoop of coffee (or a pod if you prefer).

The water reservoir is easy to get to, the controls in front are illuminated nicely, and programming it to brew coffee before he wakes up in the morning is a breeze.

He gets up before me and has the coffee pot programed to be ready when he gets up. When I get up I make tea in my travel cup (put tea bag in cup and run water through the cup side of coffeemaker). I don't use the cup that comes with the coffeemaker because it's not insulated. Had considered buying a Keurig but I priced the k-cups and they're really expensive. If you buy the tea K-cups they cost about $1 each vs a tea bag that costs 15 cents (for Grey Earl). Putting a tea bag in a cup and having the hot water go through the single cup side is just as easy and the tea comes out the same as if you put a tea kettle on and poured the water from it into a cup.

I was surprised that the instructions did not mention anything about running  water through the reservoir once before use,but I did .I have read that there was a slight plastic taste at first ,but I did not experience that. I only use filtered water. I also read in a few of the reviews that the coffee takes too long to brew.Maybe the first time or two,but now a single cup takes maybe 3 or 4 minutes and a full pot takes 5 to 7 minutes to brew.

It's brews very quickly. I love that on the single cup side I can use regular coffee. I will say this the description makes it sound like you can use K cups but you can't only pods. So I've never used it with anything but regular coffee. I wish the single cup side would brew a larger amount like my travel cup but I'd say it would fill a 16oz. Cup. Mine did not come with the travel cup. But I have got to say this is the best coffee pot I've ever owned. I love that after I make a pot of coffee it will automatically shut off in two hours because I frequently forgot to shut off my old one. It's very nice looking as well. I love setting it to brew before I wake up that's got to be my favorite. And the fact that on the mornings I need an extra kick I can set it to bold brew.

But with this 2-way brewer,  they can have their carafe of coffee and I can make my coffee from the single-serve side without having to fuss! What I love about this brewer is I've noticed no difference in taste between the coffee made in the single-serve side and the carafe side. What surprised us was the fact you can't brew both sides at the same time. Also there is some sediment from the single-serve side, but neither of those things bother me much.

I also like not having to use k-cups to make a single cup of coffee and being able to use my freshly ground coffee in the single serve brew basket.

This side comes with a metal strainer (you'll have to use paper filters or your own metal filter on the carafe side) and an adapter if you want to use pods or k-cups. I haven't tried them yet, but the scoop method works well and is very convenient during the week. The travel mug they supply is cheap, but I imagine that is so to keep the overall cost down because as you know a good travel mug is not cheap. The drip tray under the single side can be removed to accommodate larger travel mugs and stacked to use household mugs. The controls are intuitive and the machine is good looking.

It pours the water through much more slowly than the Keurig (even has a bold setting, which we love), so that the end result is a great tasting, rich cup of coffee.  It probably takes twice as long to brew a single cup versus Keurig, but it's worth it. We've had zero issues with it & would highly  recommend it!","No more weak, watery Keurig coffee!",Walmart,11

I was so excited to get the money from Christmas gifts to buy it. It was worth every penny! I got an adapter for it and love it. It works great. So I use a combination of the k cups and ground coffee in it and it's very little trouble to switch back and forth. I love the fact that it has a reservoir too. I'm glad I got this particular model.

It only made sense for me to spend $99 ($20 cheaper than amazon, best buy, other major stores) on this coffee wonder. I could prospectively save gas and money every morning by using this Keurig coffee maker. I chose this model because of the water reservoir.

205,Keurig,"November 8, 2013","Keurig K-Classic K50 Single Serve, K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker, Rhubarb",49673944,4,"Let me start off by saying I come from a family that loves their Keurig machines. I've used quite a few different models at my mom's, grandparents, and friends' homes, and can offer a comparison of the models I've used to this one I purchased for my wife for her birthday. For those of you who may see the K45 model on other sites and are wondering about the difference, there is none at all in the actual design of the machine; it just includes a filter starter kit offered at Walmart for $17 with two refill packs. First off, my basic first impressions of this particular model, the K40. It's extremely simple, with no LED display, no temp control, and three brew options (6, 8, 10 oz, approx). Unlike more expensive models, the water reservoir is not illuminated. The drip tray is removable, allowing for taller travel mugs. Everything is done in black plastic with only a silver band as the handle for opening the K-Cup holder. The power saver feature has only one setting; on or off, with a two hour window. The documentation provided suggests that it will take around four minutes to heat the water from the off setting, though in my experience it is ready in two. If you choose to disable the power saver setting, it is always ready providing you have the minimum amount of water in the reservoir. Brew time is stated to be less than a minute - very accurate. Assume 25 seconds for a 6 oz brew, 35 for an 8 oz, and 45 for a 10 oz. The capacity of the reservoir is 48 oz, meaning you will get between 4-8 brews per fill depending on cup size. Note that using K-Cups versus a reusable filter takes less time. (As a side note, I recommend the Ekobrew reusable brown filter over the official Keurig model because you do not need to switch out an additional part in the K-Cup brewer, and it is also lower-priced and dishwasher safe - Walmart offers the Ekobrew at $10 versus $17 for the official model). Now for the comparisons, starting with the K10 - the personal brewer sold for about $10 less than the K40. A family member owns one, and I have had the pleasure of using it as well. The K10 comes in several colors, making it attractive to those looking to match a kitchen layout or send a gift to a college student's dorm. Unfortunately, it really is a single-cup brewer; if you have more than one person brewing a cup at the same time, be prepared to wait about 4 minutes between cups, as the reservoir only holds enough for a single brew. It is very compact compared to the K40 though, and great for small spaces. For a single person or college student, the K10 may be the way to go, but I would suggest spending the extra $10 for the additional reservoir space if you're a couple or family, it will save you time on mornings when you're running late. The K10 and K40 offer the same cup sizes, and neither offers temp control (though in my opinion, they both come out perfectly; just below boiling temp, ready to drink. Do NOT use chilled water in either of these machines or you will end up with weaker coffee). My parents own a K70 Keurig Platinum that offers a few extras over the K40. Most importantly, it allows you to adjust the temp of the water when brewing a K-Cup. If you prefer your coffee boiling temperature or want a slightly more mild brew, it's easy to set it to do so. (Note that with the K40, if you prefer a lighter brew, simply use cold filtered water and it will turn out the same; anything out of your fridge dispenser/Brita/Pur filter would work perfectly. I do NOT recommend adding warm or hot water to the K40 tank to increase brew temp, however). A trivial detail is that it also has a programmable clock on the LED screen, though most kitchens already have an abundance of time-telling devices between their microwaves and stovetops. One major downside for me is the K70 has an illuminated water reservoir. Our kitchen in our apartment opens up to the living area, so having a blue light on all the time would have been very distracting. It can act as a decent night-light for wandering the kitchen at night though, just be aware of that difference and whether or not you want the light. One other thing I do not like about the K70 is that the drip tray is a chrome/silver color as opposed to the matte black of the K40; it looks somewhat cheap in my personal opinion, though the K70 may match well with a kitchen done in stainless steel appliances. In all, I consider this model to be the best for the price. At around $10 more than the base, single brewer model, and $50 less than the Platinum model, you're getting the best bargain for a Keurig with the full benefits of owning a single brewer. Purchase a Ekobrew alongside it and you will never regret giving up that 6, 8, or 12 cup pot that used to burn your coffee every morning after just half an hour. If you need temp control and it is worth the fifty dollars, then by all means upgrade; the K70 is an excellent machine, it just doesn't offer additional performance equal to the price in my opinion. If you need a night light for the kitchen, try your local Dollar Tree instead of paying for the upgrade. One final note; I would be cautious buying Keurig 'approved' models such as Mr. Coffee, while I have not used one, the price does not seem far off of the official models and I have heard nothing but bad stories from those I know who have owned one.",Best value for the money,Walmart,1338

You need to do this every time you switch between the two so it will create the proper seal that it needs for the water to flow right. Its no big deal but it does not tell you this in any of the packing. I use both every day. If you call Keurig they are great about customer service if you have any questions.", ,Walmart,1168
207,Keurig,"July 14, 2009","Keurig K-Classic K50 Single Serve, K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker, Rhubarb",49673944,5,"My husband bought this for me for my birthday today. I had previously owned a Hamilton Beach 6 cup brewstation. I'd had it for about a year, and it began to leak like everyone elses. I've always wanted a Keurig, but they were pretty pricey, and I wasn't sure if the coffee was worth the price. Well, I've had two cups (one k-cup and 1 made w/ my regular Maxwell house french roast using the ""my K-cup"" that I purchased seperately). Both cups were delicious. Hot and fresh tasting. This maker has a choice of 2 cup sizes. A 7.25 oz and a 9.25 oz. The larger will make a milder cup. The smaller a stronger one. The coffee maker is LOUD!!! I'd been warned of this by other owners and many reviewers, but until you hear it, you don't realize just how loud, LOUD is! However, the noise only lasts a few seconds, and for the coffee that comes out of it (w/ out leaking), I'll tolerate it. Instructions are very simple. Set-up only took a couple of minutes, and it was ready to go. Easy to fill with water. Don't know about durability, yet. The maker has a 1 yr mfg. warranty, and I bought another year for $5.88 from Wal-Mart. It comes w/ a good sampling of coffees, and teas. The k-cups are a little pricey, but once you register the machine, you can get two free boxes of k-cups when you buy 2 boxes and you get free shipping. Also, if you buy a ""my K-cup"", you can use whatever coffee you want, and come out a little cheaper. No wasted coffee!!! I highly recommed this coffee maker.",ahhhh... coffee!,Walmart,845

And I was wasting so much; undrank coffee, filters, etc. Now that I have it; I can't believe I let the price tag overshadow the potential of the Keurig. I can make a perfect cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate in under a minute flat. And the K-Cups are literally sold everywhere. I use my Keurig every single day.

But I don't drink as much coffee as I used to, so I decided to make the leap. This is a wonderful brewer for those who don't need a whole pot each morning. The water reservoir is easily removable for filling and cleaning, but the lid raises easily to refill in place. I turn mine on when I walk into the kichen and it's ready to go in no time. And yes, it does make some sounds, but they are not that loud or that long. I kinda like the sound it makes when it's done brewing, it tells me that it's ready, so I don't forget about it! And I like the option to have it stay on or cut itself off after a time. I wouldn't want to go off and leave mine on all day, or all night. This is a simple machine to use, it works very well and is a good entry machine for those who are not sure they want to make the leap. Also, you can also use it to make a hot cup of water for a package of cocoa, tea bag, or whatever else you want a cup of hot water for. I bought the reusable Cafe Cups so I could use my brand of coffee and use the amount that I prefer.

She wanted us to come into the new age and get away from the big filter and big pot of wasted coffee. Well after 2 years the keurig started having intermediate  problems. Sometimes it would flash red but not brew and shut off. Sometimes it would hum and shut off, but all the time when it brewed, it got coffee grounds in my cup. It finally died so i was used to the k cup and didn't want that to change. I brought this new one today and it gives me the best of both worlds! Filter or k cup gives us the versatility  to do either or and i love it. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the brew settings are misleading. If you want a 10 oz brew you need to set it at 12 and so on, but other than that the coffee is plenty hot and i get  no coffe grounds in my cup!

As you know 185F is the perfect standard temp for coffee brewing. This machine does a great job.  (2)Coffee temperature in the cup is about 65c/149f which is the best temp for coffee tasting.  (3) WHO recommends drinking under 65c/149f to reduce esophagus cancer Some guys measured the temperature was 149f just because he/she measured the coffee in cup ,not the actually brewing temp. I also use regular large filter paper for ground coffee,just cut to fit the ground filter and it works great.

After reading all of the other reviews I was a little worried about the leaking problem. I spent up a bit for the ""Brewmaster"" so did not want any problems and so far I have been impressed. As far as the leak goes I have encountered it several times, but not every time I use it. After the first couple of times it leaked I thought maybe it was because I didn't have the water tank seated properly or well enough. So after that I have been overly cautious about seating the tank and sure enough the next 2 or 3 brewings there was no leak. But then the, ""Dreaded"", leak came back. There was only about 1/2 cup of water on the counter. Not too bad. It was water not coffee and I have not been able to figure out what the cause is.

When I ordered online, the delivery was very quick and the product was well packaged. I gave my previous brew master to a friend. I realized why it was leaking (after a couple years) and found on the website that I could just buy the part that was leaking (seal on the bottom of the pot was worn) for a fraction of the cost ($11).

Kept the coffee nice and hot (without burning) and had a nice profile. Unfortunately after about 10 months the heating element went out. We liked the concept of the BrewStation so we ordered this model BrewStation. It has a larger footprint than the 10 cup BrewStation but not substantially. Pros: a separate holding chamber that indicates the # of cups of water for brewing coffee plus the brew chamber also indicates the # of cups of coffee available to drink. Adjustments for keeping the coffee warm, and brewing coffee strength (bold and 1-4 cup setting). We enjoy bold coffee and this unit brews a very nice tasting coffee. Cons: We prefer a nice hot cup of coffee and this unit does not brew a hot pot of coffee, nor does it keep the coffee as hot as we prefer in the chamber. I would estimate the coffee is kept at a medium drinking temperature. We have not had the product long enough to judge durability.","Nice features, but coffee isn't hot as we prefer",Walmart,50

For one the price is more than half what the charge for the Cuisinart, two makes coffee just as good, additional option for a bolder brew, and my favorite, the removable water reservoir for the ultimate convenience. I was really impressed with the overall performance. The only option I probably won't use is the ice coffee option, mainly i prefer to cold brew for an ice coffee as opposed to using ice.

Our previous BrewStation lost a couple of screws and started to leak, so we researched and found this Hamilton Beach 12-cup. We love the removable water reservoir, which our previous one did not have. It is easy to fill, easy to clean, and brews a great pot of coffee. It keeps the coffee hot for up to 4 hours, which is two hours longer than our previous one, so this was another plus! The only negative thing that we experienced, and it is very minor, is that the coffee release button seems to be positioned a bit lower than on our previous one.........so since we have mugs with a slight outward curve at the top, it misses the button when we attempt to fill the mug.

I have been using a standard drip coffeemaker for years, but this is such an improvement. I like to drink coffee throughout the morning/day, but I don't like to brew a new cup or two every hour or so, so I have been pouring my brewed coffee into a thermos to keep it hot without getting overcooked. This works okay, but is kind of a hassle -- too much stuff to clean, too easy to make a mess, etc. This method is much quicker and easier. I have not had any problems with leakage as I saw mentioned in another review. The only drawback is that the coffee in the reservoir does tend to get strong as time goes by due to the warming element, but not nearly what you would get on a carafe warmer. Also, the warmer setting only goes up to 4 hours, but it can be easily turned back on.

We spend a month or more in South Texas and last year took the Bunn we use at our home. But we have to deal with a coffee maker with water in while traveling, plus a glass pot. We wanted this coffee maker since the size will work better and no water in it while traveling, plus no glass pot to deal with. Seems to brew fast enough to satisfy my wife, coffee is hot when brewed and seems to keep hot even an hour after brewing. It is a bit light in weight and when coffee is getting low you may have to hold onto coffee maker while depressing the despenser button to prevent coffee maker from moving.

However, one of the reviews said something that really made sense to me. This man said that he took the chance and the product is great for him. So I decided to do the same thing. In my opinion rating this product on durability is premature, as durability can not be determined in two weeks. Maybe Wal-Mart should contact us for a follow up in 6 months or a year. I believe this is well worth the price I paid especially with it being on sale. As matter of fact I will be able to save money on coffee grounds because it has a BOLD setting. The first coffee I brewed was so strong that it almost walked out of the pot. So I found that by using less coffee and using the BOLD setting I could actually save money on coffee. One person said it made a loud noise when it was just sitting there. There is a slight noise made and if you spend your time next to the coffee maker it might bother you, however, I only hear it when I am getting a cup of coffee. This product more than meets my expectations after reading some of the negative comments here. It works well and the idea of taking a cup at a time is great. Not having to pour water into the machine with its normal spillage (I guess I am messy), together with not having to lift a full pot to pour a cup (again spillage when the pot is full), makes this a great coffee maker.

So when you fill it at night, you have to hold a paper towel under it so it doesn't drip everywhere. I also thought it would be good to dispense one cup of coffee at a time. Well, pushing the button in with the coffee cup does not put enough pressure on the button, so you get a very thin stream of coffee.

When I took it out of the box I read the directions. I rarely do this unless I have to put something together. In the reviews I read that the coffee maker leaked. Needless to say I was very concerned. But I also had in the back of my mind that the owners did something wrong. It clearly states to add coffee to the basket with it out of the unit. I've used this product daily for the past two weeks and there has been no leaks! As for appearance I thought the Brew Station was quite attractive and fit well with my decor. Setting the time, brew strength, time to keep warm and automatic timer was simple. The green light shows that the automatic timer is set so there is no question about it. The removable reservoir makes filling much easier than my old coffee maker. The holding tank for the coffee is also removable which makes cleaning much easier. I downgraded the unit on Meets Expectations because although it says it brews 12 cups of coffee a full tank actually brews a little over six mugs. These are the cups that came with the set of dishes I bought not something that I purchased at a coffee shop.

It's a great looking coffee maker. Once received, I was pleased to see that the product was just as pleasant on the eye as the advertisement. The carafe pours perfectly, no spills!! It has the programmable brew feature which I use on a daily basis. The brew strength feature is great and my coffee actually tastes like coffee! The clock and delay brew set window is much easier to see and is in a much better visible location than my previous coffee maker. The power/brew indicator lights are very bright and noticeable - no guessing if it's on or brewing or off. The extra little water filter disc is a little bit of a pain to deal with if you are in a hurry but it's not a major complaint. Fitting it in on top of the coffee filter just takes a few more seconds and you don't have to use it. The accompanying instructions are used/reader friendly.

I paid around $35.00 or so. I do not have any problems with the space where you pour the water in like some have stated. There is plenty of room to me. I also purchased the permanent filter which is wonderful (dump and rinse). The smell that everyone spoke about was apparent to me also. I ran vinegar through 2 times and plain water through 2 or 3 times before use. Set it to brew at 5:50 am the next morning and it worked as stated. Brewed quickly! Smell seemed to be gone completely after coffee was made and have not had a smell issue since. Hope this pot last a long time and am happy I read about it in consumer reports magazine.

I have the chrome and black one because the red and black would've stood out in my color scheme. It looks very sophisticated, and quite honestly doesn't look like it cost as little as it did. I rated the durability a ""4"" because there is a plastic part that sucks up the water inside the pot that moves very easily back and forth over the filter and also when the lid closes.

Then we dried it with paper towels. In fact, we did this step a total of four times! We gave up and decided that maybe the odor would disappear if we brewed a pot of coffee. Nope. Three pots were attempted and the odor persisted. In all, we spent several hours with repeating the process. I've never had an experience like it. I bought the coffee pot online @Walmart. The order was placed in the late afternoon and I received an email that it was ready for pickup just a couple hours later. No complaints at all for Walmart. The problem was with the Mr. Coffee.

I followed the directions in the booklet that came with the machine, and ran water through the machine after washing the parts. I have not smelled or tasted even the smallest notion of plastic. I like that the machine beeps when the coffee is done. It also beeps when the machine turns off after the two hours. Having the option for coffee strength is also a really nice option. Also, this is the first glass decanter I have owned that does not spill the coffee down the edge of it when poured. There are only two drawbacks: The lid to the glass decanter is not removable. It looks like it could be, but do not attempt, it is not. Also the space to pure the water into the machine is narrow. Those are such minimal things to me though.

280,Mr. Coffee,"January 13, 2016","Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista Espresso Maker, Black/Silver (BVMC-ECMP1000)",24293168,3,"We were excited to get this and start using over our other Mr Coffee Cafe` latte maker that has served us well for the past few years. The Pros - We like the way the coffee/espresso tastes out of this machine compared to our Cafe` Latte maker. It's more like what you get from your local coffee stand and that says alot. It also uses less coffee/espresso to make your cup (1.5 scoops vs 4) than our previous one and less syrups (3 pumps vs 4) which will save us money in the end. I like having the variety of being able to switch from latte to Cappuccino or just plain espresso. The buttons that allow you to choose between 12 and 16 oz on the latte or 6oz and 10oz on the Cappuccino is great, but that is sort of where it ends. The Cons - Doesn't produce anywhere close to the claimed amounts on the box or instructions. If you press large Latte,which is supposed to produce 16 oz, it produces around half that. In fact in order to get a full 16oz drink I have to press large and when that is finished, press small, which should be 28oz total, to get around 14oz in my cup not including syrup for whatever flavor you want. I've actually started using a Pyrex measuring cup to make the coffee, then put it in whatever container I'm going to use for that day..regular coffee cup when I'm home or to go mug when leaving. Missing from the milk reservoir is lines on the side that would indicate what is needed for the different drinks. Instead you fill it, make your drink and have to pour the remaining back into your milk container...huh? I've noticed that the very first drink of the day tends to spit out ALOT of foam regardless of the foam setting I have set it to on the side of the Milk reservoir. After that, it seems fine. Perhaps left over water in the pump from cleaning it? Not sure. Other thoughts - If we didn't order this directly from Mr Coffee and got it somewhere local, we'd of already returned it. As it is, we'll keep it until it either breaks or something else better is out. Attached are the pics showing what is produced. The first pic shows what the Large Latte produces with no syrups in. Also the first drink of the day..notice the amount of foam. The second pic shows the cumulative of adding the small latte along with my syrup for a Mocha. Third pic shows what the second drink is using the Large Latte button. Notice the low amount of foam. Fourth pic shows the addition of the small latte button but without adding syrup to illustrate the actual amount of latte.",Not bad - but needs some tweaking.,Walmart,97

Here is a latte maker that makes them in 5 mins or less with what you choose to put in it.  This is basically the K-compact with an added milk steamer/frother. They did however tweak it so that it accommodates most travel mugs now as well. The steamer/frother only works once the water is heated up which takes 90 secs or less. It does take about 2.5 mins for the milk to be steamed and then frothed inside the nonstick steamer. Be aware that all milk is not created equal as far as frothing goes. Heavy cream, half & half and milk do froth up the best. Some brands of almond milk will do slightly where as some of our chain stores brands won't at all. There will be residual foam left inside the steamer so best to use a small silicone spoon to get it out.  Reusable Kcups do work in this as well.

I have had more lattes in the past couple weeks than I have had in my entire life! My mother enjoys cup after cup of coffee from the traditional part of the coffee machine. I love that the frother sits directly on the base of the machine so that it doesn't take up any extra space on my counter. The frother is easy to clean which is nice.

Latte for my honest rating and review. My package was shipped very secured with no damage or dents to the packaging. I received 1- single serve coffee latte maker that includes a milk frother, and 3 boxes of green mountains brand coffee in espresso roast, breakfast blend and vanilla espresso roast. The coffee/ latte maker has 4 options for brewing in cup sizes 6oz, 8oz, 10oz and a shot option for lattes. The brewing is very easy to use. You plug in, fill the water reservoir, click fill water and put your pod inside. The option light will blink for you to choose a cup size, then after choosing it works instantly. There is no waiting for the water to heat it works instantly. It also has an auto shut off after 2 hours in case you forget to turn off. When using the milk frother, you fill milk to the line and place it on the base and push power. The button will illuminate for 3 minuets then blink. It automatically turns off when done. I was very please with how easy and fast this product works. I normally never have time to make coffee when I am rushing out the door so I have to buy it outside. This coffee/ latte make makes it so much easier to get my coffee as I am rushing out the door, and if I forget to turn it off I don��t have to worry because of it's auto turn feature. I love built in frother feature. It makes absolutely perfect milk. My son loves warm milk and now demands I make him frothed milk every morning.

305,Keurig,"July 30, 2018","Keurig K-Latte Single Serve K-Cup Coffee and Latte Maker, Comes with Milk Frother, Compatible With all Keurig K-Cup Pods, Black",669553233,4,"Honestly, I had no idea what a Latte was, nor how to make one, and that's why I requested this Keurig product to review for Walmart; so that shoppers can read a first-hand review from a Newbie Keurig Owner! My only other interactions with Keurig coffee makers was while visiting friends' homes and, most recently, this summer at my hotel where I stayed for 25 days. I have always enjoyed the Keurig machines and once I saw one in my hotel room, I ran out and purchased a case of Keurig coffee pods (because hotels never give you enough coffee, right?). So I think I am able to compare my experience with this new Keurig with other Keurig machines I have used in the past (but never owned). Upon my initial brew, I found all of the buttons to be a tad confusing, and the included instructions didn't help to guide me enough. I saw a ""Latte/Shot"" button and that took me several days to figure out what it meant. I was able to watch some Keurig Latte-making instructional videos for this machine on Walmart.com and that's when I finally succeeded at making one. Sorry, I didn't quite yet understand how Shot and Latte go together but now I know. Prior to ever making the first cup of coffee, I did several cleansing ""brews,"" without a coffee pod; only with bottled water. Keurig only suggests doing it once, but I did it several times. I used bottled water for the cleansing because, there does not seem to be a Purge function on this coffee maker, so I would never know when the cleansing water (let's say, tap water) would have gone all the way through before pouring in my bottled water for coffee. Filling the water tank reservoir is easy; it is removable for filling and easy to replace. However, coffee will not brew if the ADD WATER light is lit (adjacent to the Start button) indicating the water tank is at a low level. While this is probably a safety feature, there was plenty of water in the reservoir, and probably more inside the machine to make at least a 10 oz. cup of coffee, so I'm not quite sure why the indicator says to add water before it will function when there seems to be plenty in there already? While on vacation using the hotel's Keurig, I noticed that it was smart enough NOT to start brewing if I failed to place a coffee cup on the cup tray; unfortunately, this K-Latte machine does not have that coffee cup sensor feature built in; it brewed coffee without a cup in the tray so I assume this means there is no cup sensor on this machine. I would strongly suggest for Keurig to add this cup sensor safety feature to this machine. When I finally learned how to operate the Latte Frother, I noticed I could not do two things at once. I could not froth the milk while brewing coffee at the same time. There seems to be a lock feature built in where the consumer can only operate either the frother or the coffee maker one at a time, but not both. It took me awhile to figure out that the Latte Frother had its own start button feature on the frother itself; I found the SHOT/LATTE button misleading (to me) - couldn't figure out when to push this button - for a Latte...for a shot...for coffee...?? (and this is WHY the machine should have a cup sensor on it). I frothed the milk several times but in all reality, I had to grab a spoon and scoop the froth out each time. I don't think this is how it is supposed to operate. The frother definitely needed to be cleaned; had milk gunk at the bottom each time-maybe like the milk was starting to burn (but it didn't). The whisk inside the frother was easy to just pull up and out for cleaning, but the frother is deep, and if you have large hands (mine are regular-size), good luck with installing that small piece again without effort; it was very cumbersome, could not see inside with my hand in there, and just had to feel around until it fit back in place. I worry about mis-placing the whisk; I hope parts are available just in case. Basic instructions talk about cleaning the entrance and exit needles. In order to see the entrance needles to perform the ""paperclip"" cleaning, I'd need a flashlight. I can feel the needles but can't really see what I am doing to clean. As far as taking the pod assembly apart to clean the exit needle, this too had basic instructions and I have yet to accomplish this; I don't want to force anything for fear of breaking something. Overall, I think it is a great coffee and Latte machine, but there are tiny parts and some under-the-microscope-maintenance involved to maintain the machine in good working order. Suggestions to Keurig would be to write the instructions for the beginner/novice. Place more safety features into this machine such as, a cup sensor. Have the Keurig engineers figure out how to brew coffee and whisk milk in the frother all at the same time. Also, there should be a PURGE feature on ALL Keurig machines so that water does not sit inside the water tank and machine while the consumer is away, let's say, on vacation (this is a main complaint from my Keurig-owning friends). And most important, Keurig engineers should be figuring out a better way to clean the needles instead of the consumer having to use a paperclip (which is NOT included with the Keurig machine). I love my new Coffee / Latte machine ... it's awesome! I rated this a 4 out of 5 based on my above comments. Keurig is a Leader and I know that they are innovative enough to work on the small issues I have mentioned. Thank you, Keurig, for a wonderful machine; I look forward to many years of use, great coffee and making a great Latte!",Newbie Keurig novice beginner here; my 1st Latte!,Walmart,0

The footprint of the machine isn't much bigger than my other countertop appliances, and it sits back from the edge of the counter far enough to not take over the usable counter space at all. I love that the frother could be taken off the unit and the base can be folded up if you don't use it, so it makes the unit take up even less space on the counter. I love that there are 3 different cup sizes, so that give it a lot of flexibility to what size drink you could make.

So this is Keurig K-Latte single serve coffee and latte maker. Although I do enjoy freshly brewed coffee with traditional coffee maker, sometimes I really don't have time so Keurig single serve comes to help. You just pop any k-cup and a cup of delicious coffee is ready in a split second. If you spend another few seconds to add milk to the frothed part you get to fancy up your coffee with frothed milk. The frothed is very easy to clean. You do have to clean it after every use though.  You can make three different sizes of coffee cup - 6, 8 and 10 oz. There is also a coffee shot option for specialty drinks. For example to make a latte you just brew a coffee shot using one of the k-cups, you froth the milk, you pour it in your coffee and there it is - your delicious cup of latte. The frother is a really great addition here. This is a great little helper for people on the go, it is an important part of our crazy fast paced lives. I would definitely recommend it to those who never have time in the morning.",Great coffee on the go,Walmart,0

This was my first time owning a Keurig or other coffee-pod machine. It came well packaged and included three boxes of Green Mountain pods: Breakfast Blend, Vanilla Espresso Roast, and Vista 44°N Espresso Roast. The machine does coffee shots for specialty driniks; includes a frother, which works with skim milk, soy, and almond; and adjusts for three cups sizes: six, eight, and ten ounces. Inside the box (the third and final box; very securely packaged) on top was a quick start guide that include nice coupons for pods and cleaner. There was some tape to remove and the frother was bagged and wrapped, other than that the machine came out ready for the cleaning cycle. On the counter, it does take up a lot of space. I have a small kitchen with little counter space so that is an issue. Currently, I have a four-cup coffee machine with a small footprint. Even not leaving it out would be issue because it would take up so much of my limited cabinet space. Something to keep in mind for those living in small spaces. The platform for the frother folds up, so that helps.  The set-up process was really simple. A couple of bits of tape to remove, clean a few pieces, run a brewing cycle without a pod, & viola, you're all set. Using it is likewise simple. There is a large tank for water. Hitting the power button heats it up. When it's ready you have four options: ten ounce, eight ounce, six ounce, and coffee shot (used for lattes). Pop in a pod, pick a button, close, & coffee. For the frother, you add cold milk, dock it on the machine, and hit power. It heats up the milk while frothing it. Easy peasy. It does not work independently of the Keurig. The coffee is easy and will be convenient when I have people over. I love the variety of pod options. You do have to run a cleaning cycle after using hot chocolate or other non-coffee pods. However, the frother is not impressive. It doesn't produce much foam. I use 2% milk, other types might give better results, but looking around the internet it seems like I should still be getting decent foam. I have repeatedly ended up with a little foam and mostly warm milk. I have never used a frother, so that may be what it's supposed to do. Overall positive, but if I'm ever in the market I would look for a steam wand.","Convenient For Coffee, Frother Not What I Expected",Walmart,0

The unit heats water up in no time at all for our use. We do wish that we could us a reusable k-cup to make the tea and hot cocoa, but from what we have read is that tea does not get to steep long enough to make a good cup and the hot cocoa plugs up the machine. So we will just use it for the hot water for now. As for making a frothy milk to top your drink off with it work great, it makes it nice and hot and frothy. It is a good addition to the hot cocoa. Adds that milky flavor and texture. Would I recommend this to a friend, of course I would.

It is great to be able to experience finely ground coffee Espresso by making a two ounce shot to concentrate the drink in this Keurig Espresso maker. The two ounce shot button makes the very hot water come out slower than the other settings, according to a Keurig Rep., and this makes the Espresso become more intensely concentrated. Keurig makes it simple to have an Espresso. All my life I was interested in trying Espresso, this is my first cup, and it is very noticeably different from coffee. I find this Espresso to be very smooth, finely rich, and with a much stronger flavor than my regular coffee. Keurig Espresso definitely is an enjoyable, strong, concentrated coffee drink. I like so much that the frother can be powered on from its own power button right on the canister and froths the milk without using a button on the main machine. Thus, there is no way to make a mistake pressing the wrong button and making water come out when no mug is there to catch it. I like to keep an empty mug sitting under the spout to catch any spills. The buttons all light up blue after lifting the K-Cup handle and lowering it. It is easy to see the amounts and pick out what size drink is wanted. When the two ounce shot button is pushed, the brewer sends extremely hot water through the K-Cup pod more slowly to make sure Espresso is very concentrated for your drink, and two ounce shot can be pushed more than once to make a larger Espresso. Frothing takes only a minute or two when filled to minimum, three when full to the maximum line. Put froth in first in amount from three to nine times more than the two or more (2 oz.) shots of Espresso topping it, making a creamy café latte. Fill up the cup with equal amounts of frothed milk above the Espresso shot to make a café macchiato. Cappuccino is made with any varying amount of froth to Espresso. Mocha café latte can also be made by combining Espresso with hot chocolate or chocolate syrup in the cup after putting the froth in first. Espresso can be purchased by the pound and packed into a My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter to make Espresso without a disposable K-Cup pod.","Brews a Refreshing, Delicious Variety of Drinks",Walmart,0

Its tall enough it will not fit under some of my cabinets. Also hard to move out from under the cabinet to open the top and insert the pod. If I grab the machine by both sides to pull it out the feet on the bottom dont slide well and then the tank slides out of position. I bought a special small tray slider but it made the unit even higher and then would not fit under any of my cabinets.

This is something people look forward to in the morning at home or at work. Unfortunately, the same pot of coffee brewed would sit for hours and people often complain that the coffee tasted “old” and stale. And it seems to be a waste of money dumping a half pot of coffee into the sink just to make a fresh pot. Keurig solved that problem! Now the Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker offers more than what you expect. Coffee in a flash! The Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker brews coffee in a minute. Compared to older Keurig coffee maker, the K-Elite brews coffee in no time. No more waiting in line for those who are anxious to start their day in the morning. This is a big plus for busy people like myself. And if you are one of those coffee aficionados who prefer to grind their coffee beans for “fresher taste”, the Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker can also accommodate universal reusable coffee pods for grounded beans. There is really no excuse to why you cannot have fresh coffee whenever you need it. The Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker comes with easy-to-read instructions to set-up. So setting up and getting started is not a problem. The buttons and settings on the machine are self-explanatory – the buttons have symbols for easy recognition.You cannot go wrong using this machine. How does it look? At first glance, the Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker is just your typical coffee maker; but with a sleek look and an elegant style, this coffee maker fits any kitchen décor. This is for those who like to mix and match their kitchen appliance. The Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker offers more variety of cup sizes from 3 to 5 cup sizes that include larger travel mugs. I like to have this option because there are times you need a small amount of coffee to go or to have a big mug of coffee at your workstation. The water compartment is also bigger and lighted! The lighting feature in the Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker water compartment made it easier to see the water level. No more second guessing or turning on a flashlight to see how much water you have. Besides the addition of multiple size cups/mugs, the Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker can offer a stronger brew – which is a really big plus for those overtime days at work! A stronger coffee kick is now at your fingertips. I can go on and on about the exciting features I found about the Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker. I am really happy and satisfied with this. I think it is time for people to discover and experience what the Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker can offer. Overall, you can never go wrong with all Keurig brand products. Keurig will always offer you the best-tasting coffee whatever “K” series you decide to purchase. Keurig is always a brand you can trust.",Great tasting coffee in a flash!,Walmart,1

326,Keurig,"March 8, 2018","Keurig K-Elite Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker with Iced Coffee Setting, Strength Control, and Hot Water on Demand, Brushed Silver",564807397,4,"A few years ago I noticed the K-cup style coffee maker showing up in friends' homes and doctors' offices. This coffee maker has a unique design, and while I found it innovative and interesting, I did not pursue the product. I've been utilizing the pour-over technique for a while now, and that has served me well. I was given the opportunity to use and review a Keurig® K-Elite™ Single Serve Coffee Maker, along with a few K-cup pods. Setting up the machine was easy, but it did take a few read-throughs on the instructions to understand how to properly use the product. The process is very simple. After doing it a couple of times, I had no trouble.  Thus far my family has very much enjoyed the K-Elite™. It's very convenient, and I like the fact that I don't have to “babysit” it, as I had to do with my pour-over technique. The coffee is hot without being scalding. While I have enjoyed having the pods (not included in the K-Elite™ package), I do see a couple of drawbacks. When pricing the pods in the store, I found most boxes to be much more expensive per ounce of product compared to loose ground coffee. The K-cup concept is also not particularly eco-friendly either. With every K-cup use, that is more garbage in our landfills. I found that a good alternative to this was to purchase a reusable K-cup filter, one that I can fill with ground coffee that is already a part of my pantry. True, I have to dump out the filter and clean it after every use, so it is not as convenient as a disposable K-cup, but I feel better about doing it this way. The landfills and my wallet will ultimately thank me. Overall I do like the Keurig® K-Elite™ Single Serve Coffee Maker. Customers purchasing this product and unfamiliar with the process should be prepared to read the instructions a bit. I would also recommend purchasing a reusable filter to save money and to be kinder to the environment. I do plan on continuing to use this product into the future.","Nice product!

I used to pull the old model from under my kitchen cabinet every time I used it in order to lift the handle. The new one is about ½ inch shorter, and due to the new design, it opens more forward than up, meaning it fits much fits better under a cabinet. (see photo - underneath my 17.5 inch cabinet) Yet, the water reservoir is almost 3 measuring cups larger…. Instead of two sizes of coffee to select from, there are now five. The coffee maker automatically turns itself off, but you are able to change the timer on how long you want it to stay on, starting with 15 minutes and going up. The clock/timer is back lit nicely in blue and is easier to read than before…. ....The major difference, (one that I love) is WHEN you choose the size of cup you wish to fill. On the previous model you turn the machine on, let it heat up until the coffee- cup lights come on. Then you insert one of the pods, close, and when the lights blink, select the size you want. Not a big problem. But in the new version, this is done all at once. Turn it on, insert the coffee pod, close, and select the size. When you return to it, in about 2 minutes 30 seconds (the older model took maybe 15 seconds less, but that's if you were standing right by it while it heated!) the coffee is in your cup ready to drink…..  ...I think the new Keurig is also bit quieter. A separate button is available for “strong” coffee. It was ready to use in just a few minutes out of the box. Glad I have it!",Positive improvements,Walmart,0

I have used this coffee maker for at least two weeks. If you like strong coffee like we do, the K-Elite does not disappoint. Not only is it a beautiful appliance, it does so much. It has a nice brushed premium finish. It offers a 75 ounce removable water reservoir. That is just the start of this machine. It brews 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ounce, tumbler size. There is a timer to automatically turn on and turn off. There is also a strong brew option, which we love, and an iced coffee or tea setting, with an adjustable temperature from 187 degrees to 192 degrees. Option of hot water on demand. It also comes with a Keurig filter, and there is a brewer maintenance reminder. The buttons light up the color of blue. The water reservoir has a blue light as well. Very attractive. But the best thing is that it makes great coffee in no time at all. I use REVV No Surender Dark Roast pods. The setting we use is the strong option and 10 ounces of water. Delicious.

I am a first time user of any type of single serve coffee maker. Normally I have the luxury of brewing a full pot of coffee and drinking it every morning. But I have to admit that being able to brew one cup of fresh coffee in a couple of minutes throughout the day is nice! The K-Elite is perfect for just that. It is easy to program with the push of a couple of buttons. With the push of a button it will brew in 5 different cup sizes: 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 ounce capacities. Remove the drip tray and your travel mug fits right under the brew nozzle. If you like bold full flavor coffee, push the “strong” button. If you want an iced coffee, put a 16 ounce tumbler with ice in it under the brew nozzle and select the “iced” button. Just want hot water for a cup of soup, a cup of tea or a hot cocoa? Leave the coffee pod out and press the “hot water” button. The water reservoir is a large 75 ounces so you can make several cups of coffee or hot water before having to refill it. The water reservoir has a blue LED light in it that is on when the K-Elite is on and when the reservoir is getting low it starts flashing and will flash until you refill it.

This Keurig has a nice size reservoir on the side, and lit up buttons on top, so you know how many ounces of coffee you would like to make up. I would not trade this for anything else, because we had a cheaper version off this and it did not work as great or as easy as the Keurig does.

I was so psyched to be able to do this. I have always dreamed of owning one , any Keurig, but my husband is a stickler for his old coffee pot. Its a perculator that has certainly seen better days. Well when this arrived it quite literally knocked both our socks off. I will be honest, its huge but with that being said I found a spot for it. My craft room, front and center. I love this thing to no end. I have made coffee several times a day from it over the past month and given my husband a cup at least daily also and he loves it. Believe me that says a lot. First off I was impressed that they included 2 boxes of 16 count NEWELY RELEASED K-Cups. The Bolder of the two is quite adequately named REV~No Surrender Dark Roast Coffee and the other which unto itself has a really nice bold flavor but a subtle undertone compared to REV, which is COLUMBIA HUILA. Both will make a wonderful addition to your K-Cup collection. As for this amazing machine well to set it up I thought I was going to get overwhelmed because It looks like you have to do a lot but it actually went quite smoothly. I calmly read ALL the directions first, start to finish. I did this at a time when I wasn't in a rush therefore I was able to concentrate and all went quite well and far quicker then anticipated. Within 10 minutes of finishing my reading of the directions and soaking the filter for the alloted 5 minutes , attaching the stem and running through a cup of just plain water to give it a go and I was then ready to have my first cup. HEAVENLY. I can't come close to saying how much I love this Keurig. It has easy controls, it is so easy to fill the side where the water is stored, and the water temp adjustment is easy to control although I don't really adjust because the manufactures suggested temp is fine by me. I have not yet tried the iced coffee, between living through a rough winter and enjoying the warm coffee and hot cocoa I haven't felt the need, but I can say in all honesty I can not see how it would be anything less then perfect. It is so easy to do, fill a glass up with ice and make your cup just like you would a cup of coffee, only difference is you would need to remove the bottom drip plate to accomidate for the height of your cup or mug, same as you would do for a travel mug. I am looking forward to trying out the other flavor coffees, possibly purchasing K-Cup Basket so I am able to make my own coffee if ever I am out of K-Cups. Believe me  you can't go wrong with this machine. It's ""All that and More!""

334,Keurig,"February 26, 2018","Keurig K-Elite Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker with Iced Coffee Setting, Strength Control, and Hot Water on Demand, Brushed Silver",564807397,4,"This is the fourth Keurig I've owned. The previous three (different models) lasted between 2-3 years, and because of some performance issues I had with them, plus believing they should have lasted longer, I decided not to invest in another Keurig. So I was thrilled when they offered me one to test and review, because I've always loved the convenience and speed of the Keurig, and the coffee was always delicious.  Unboxing to setup to enjoying my first cup of coffee took less than 30 minutes. I was happy that the Keurig Water Filter was redesigned because the old water filter took up far too much space in the water reservoir. This one is great. I also like the extra large capacity of the Elite's water reservoir. Slightly disappointed that the front of the reservoir on the Elite isn't clear plastic (the sides are) because the way the machine sits on my counter I don't see the ambient blue light in the reservoir. My previous Keurigs had completely clear water tanks, and the ambient lighting produced was the perfect nightlight in my kitchen.  My first brews in my new machine were using Keurig Hot ""Laughing Man"" Colombia Huila K-Cup pods (delicious, BTW!). I tested each cup size selection --4, 6, 8, 10 & 12 oz.-- and each came out to the precise measurement, all tasting delicious. And my 12 oz. tall travel cup, which I use exclusively, fit without removing the drip tray.  There's a very useful feature the Elite has that my previous Keurig models didn't, a sleep option for the internal water heating reservoir. If you turn it on, you can choose from 15 minutes to 120 minutes for the internal water heater to shut off automatically. I'm pretty sure the reason my previous model became unusable was because I didn't have this feature; the internal (inaccessible) hot water reservoir became cracked, so hot water constantly leaked all over my counter and drained the external reservoir. So I'm loving the sleep mode! You can wake the Keurig from sleep mode by pushing the power button, and it just takes it a minute to heat the water for a perfect brew. There's also an automatic wake mode you can set if you want it to automatically wake at the same time every day. However, the machine's clock is 12 hours, rather than 24, so if you set it to wake at say 8:00, it does so at both 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. No big deal.  Was excited that this model has such a large water tank. BUT my excitement about that diminished by day 2. My water tank wasn't quite HALF empty when the ""add water"" light came on, and I couldn't brew until I topped off the tank. Not much point to a large water reservoir when you HAVE to add more water when you've used less than half the tank. Peculiar issue, which kept me from giving this Keurig 5 stars.  Some people have commented that the Keurig is noisy. Really??? My dishwasher, food processor, and blender are FAR noisier, and the ""noise"" of the Keurig lasts about a minute. NOT an issue at all!  Bottom line, I'm so happy to have a Keurig again, and I think the improvements in this Elite model have fixed the problem that caused my previous models to break too soon. Just wish the water reservoir was completely clear so I could fully enjoy the ambient blue light, and the ""add water"" issue, but certainly not a deal breaker.   I'd recommend the Keurig Elite to anyone who wants quick, delicious coffee. It's especially great for someone like me who lives alone and only drinks 1 or 2 cups a day.",Extremely convenient,Walmart,0

However, after receiving the KEURIG K-Mini Plus Single Serve Coffee Maker complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster, I gave it a try.  The KEURIG K-Mini Plus has a sleek modern design that fits just about anywhere and doesn't clutter counter space. I love the how the K cups fit neatly into a holder that also slides back into the K-Mini Plus when not in use. It's simple with just two buttons: the power button and the brew button.  The K-Mini Plus makes brewing a cup of coffee effortless. Fill your mug with water, pour it in the resvoiur, put in the K-cup, power on, and press the silver brew button. Rich, flavorful coffee brews in 2-3 minutes. After using the K-Mini Plus, I realized how much coffee I was wasting by making full pots. My full pot coffee maker has the option to brew a single cup, however, I never tried it because it seemed so tideous having to measure the water and the amount of coffee needed for one cup. The K-Mini Plus makes brewing a cup of coffee so simple and easy.  The K-Mini Plus is definitely worth it, I love it!","I was skeptical, then I fell in love!",Walmart,3

The water tank is only big enough to hold water for one cup of coffee. So you don't have to worry about the leftover water in the tank becoming gross like you do with some of the bigger coffee makers. The coffee tastes great, and the whole process to make the coffee is super easy. The only downside is the quality of the keurig. The material is very lightweight, but it does not feel or look as high-quality and sleek as it could. The compartment that holds the k-cups takes a little bit of jostling to fit back into the keurig. That being said, I love having that compartment, and it makes it really easy to grab a k-cup.

I enjoy my coffee strong and you can tell the difference between both settings which is great! You have to dispose the k-cup yourself after the coffee is done which is the only con however, the pro's really outweigh the one con from the K-Mini Plus.

My burgeoning coffee-snob self quickly moved onto French presses, vacuum brewing, and other fancy gadgets until I finally bought an espresso machine, which was all well and good except for how much of a pain it got get a simple cup of coffee in the mornings anytime I'm in a rush (so basically Monday through Friday).  When I was sent the K-Mini Plus, I was instantly intrigued by the machine's small (and even aesthetically pleasing) profile and seeming ease-of-use; it's slim, with hidden storage for k-cups and even storage for the (kind of short) cord. The reservoir is designed to hold only enough water for one cup of coffee at a time (with delineation for a 6oz, 8oz, or 12oz cup), but I actually like this better because it's a breeze to put just enough water in the cup that I'm going to use and then pouring it into the tank right as I plug it in. The fact that it's smaller will probably also make it easier to clean.  Now for the coffee itself...I was thoroughly impressed. Gone was the watery taste that I remembered, and the whole process was so quick that generally by the time I got back to the machine with milk and sugar, the coffee was already pouring into my cup. The ""strong"" option did make a slightly more fragrant cup, but it wasn't a huge difference.  All in all, I'm really impressed with the machine and how easy it was to slip it into my hectic morning routine.

It feels limiting, as we have our favorite brand of coffee that, as of right now, does not make K-Cups. I'm sure someone will figure something out eventually, but as of right now, you're stuck with the 2.0 K-Cups ONLY. The coffee, however, is DELICIOUS.

Each family member uses the auto on/off feature to have the water in the reservoir preheated at different times. The machine is quiet, and the water heats up rather quickly, and the beverage stays hot for a good while. Before each drink I make, I always do a cleansing brew to make sure there are no leftover coffee grounds from the previous user's K-Cup. One time I made a cup without cleansing, and it had some grounds in it. So far I have only made coffee, but I bought some Swiss Miss Cocoa K-Cups and plan to use them soon. I don't have a problem with the fact that you can't use older K-Cups, generic K-Cups, or your own grounds. Since I never had a Keurig before, I didn't have any laying around going to waste, and I don't mind buying the newer Keurig Brewed cups, and it's no skin off my back just using the flavors Keurig offers. I would change how much water you need to put in the reservoir. I use bottled water, and it takes too many of my bottles to fill the container.

380,Nespresso,"December 11, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville, Grey",316548713,5,The Breville Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee & Espresso Single-Serve Machine is the best. I no longer need to go to buy my coffee outside of my house. This system is absolutely amazing. I feel like I have become my own personal barista. Is product not only comes with the coffee maker it also comes with the milk warmer and coffee pods to go inside. Assembly is very easy. I would suggest reading through your owner's manual 4 setup and how to use the product. Every cup of coffee comes out perfect and delicious. I've yet to find a flavor that I did not like. This would make a great holiday or birthday gift. Or a wonderful gift for yourself. This product is worth every penny. Think of all the money you'll save on a daily basis buying coffee elsewhere when you can make it at home. When it bruise it is not Extremely Loud which is nice.

381,Nespresso,"December 10, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville, Grey",316548713,5,"This coffee maker is like nothing I have ever owned or even seen at someone's house! The Nepresso Vertuoplus single-serve coffee and expression machine is pretty awesome. It uses centrifuge technology which you can hear and also see in the finished product. It's amazing to me that the machine can read the barcode on the capsule. I'll start from the beginning from receiving and using this new coffee and expresso machine. I used the quick guide to learn the basic functions and cup sizes. This machine makes expresso (1.35oz), gran lungo (5.07 oz), coffee (7.77 oz), and alto (14 oz) sizes. It comes with an instruction book, which in my opinion is needed. The step by step instructions are very clear and well written. When you first unpack your machine you are supposed to be able to turn it on, fill up the water tank, and rinse the system by pressing the button 3 times. Once the light around the button turned green I would press it, but it would flash red twice and nothing else would happen. On a good note, this helped me realize there is a troubleshooting section in the instruction book and it is very precise and helpful. The only thing I could figure out is I had to use a capsule to rinse the machine. I didn't want to waste a good flavor, so I inserted the decaf capsule and the machine worked. Once the machine produces the desired amount per capsule you open the lid and it shoots the capsule to the back into the back capsule container. I grabbed the used decaf capsule and re-used it 2 more times to rinse the machine. I love how this machine has only one button, it makes things very easy, even though this machine is high tech. When you touch the front lever upwards it electronically opens and vice versa when pressing it down. When you have a capsule inside and you open it, the capsule automatically shoots towards the back. I don't really understand this concept. I'm assuming it helps produce less of a mess. I can see where several capsules would stack up and then you could dump the container, but it still produces some dirtiness inside the container you would need to rinse. I would just prefer to grab the capsule out and throw it away, but instead this machine tosses it to the back so if you don't want to keep opened capsules in the back you would need to empty that container and rinse it each time. The used capsule container is very easy to slide out either left or right and put back in. The water container is also very easy to take out, fill up, and put back in. You can also slide it from one side to the other or straight back depending on how you want it to look or how you need it to fit in a certain area on the counter, etc. Now for the coffee... I've only tried one capsule, but it was wonderful. You insert the capsule, then the light flashes green. Once the light is a steady green (which only takes a couple of seconds) you hit the button and you hear the centrifuge technology start. The coffee seems to almost immediately start making and wow it comes out looking fancy. As shown in my pictures, the coffee is frothy, but in a good way. This machine really makes it perfect. I tasted the coffee from the pod without milk or creamer first and it was good. I don't like black coffee. These pods are really cool and the box that comes with them explains their individual tastes and what tastes will change when milk is added. I really think I will love this machine, but i looked up the cost of the pods and they aren't cheap. It did seem that I could find generic comparable pods (still not super cheap), but I'm not sure how that will work since the machine reads the barcode. Overall, if you want nice coffee or expresso I really don't think you can go wrong with this.",Pretty amazing,Walmart,0

This machine has a very simple yet elegant design. The water tank is moveable, and helps to save space on the counter. There's a button that you push up on and the lid opens manually, and you push down and it closes automatically. Nice design. The pod even automatically dispenses when it opens back up and the used pods store in the back.  I love the idea of the pods seem to be made of aluminum and if that is true can be recycled easier. The machine comes with 12 pods in a sample pack.  Pods are comparable to the price of K-cups. They might be a bit more expensive however the coffee is very nice.  Overall I am very pleased with this machine it brews a cup of expresso to a full cup of coffee. It has an adjustable drip plate depending on the size of cup you want.

I have never seen an Espresso being made before. It was cool. It even looked like what it does in the commercials. I didn't know that it would. I thought some of that was due to it being on TV. But it isn't. It really looks like what you see on TV.  The Nespresso Machine has a ""first time cleaning"" mode. It is also for when you have not used it for a while. It is a little weird. It makes weird noises. And it takes it several minutes to start. It made me wonder whether or not it was gonna do something. But it did start and cleaned it.  One thing that is important to know, the machine is automated. You do not force the top up or down. All you have to do is touch the button and it moves on its own. Did not know this. Could not figure out how to make it move. Then I plugged it in, touched the button, and it moved all by itself. Did surprise me. I did not see anything in the instructions that said that this is how it was.  The machine comes with a variety pack of pods. It is a good start for seeing what type you may like. Or not like. It has different strengths and flavors. And some are coffee and some are espresso. And the machine has a place in the back that the pods are popped out into. Then all you have to do is dump the bin that they are in. No touching hot pods. That is nice.  The water reservoir comes off kind of hard. But that is because of the water tight seal that it has to make when put in place. Also do not turn it upside down when there is water in it. The top of it does not seal. You will spill water.  The machine is 12 3/4"" tall, 8 1/2"" deep, and 5 1/2"" wide. And is a nice color. It looks very nice.",Interesting Machine,Walmart,0

I loved that it came with a box of 12 so that we had a variety to select from. It was super easy just set up, plug in and fill water tank pop in a pod and your ready to go. With this machine it was really no effort. Now I didn't like how many times I had to press the button to get it to work. I'm going to have to read it now to see how to adjust the cup size because to me the coffee is not quite enough for a regular coffee mug. My favorite part of this machine is that when you are done brewing your pod just open and it gets rid of the pod for you and it is ready for the next one. Flips it right into the back of the machine for later disposal. I have tried two of the pods and I liked them just with it was a bigger cup with same flavor. I find I do need to add cream to the coffee as the steam on top is almost as much as the coffee in the cup. My coworkers however found the coffee flavor to be too strong and they did not care for them and they tried the flavored ones like the vanilla.

The Breville brews a very rich and frothy cup of coffee every time. I like dark, rich, robust coffee, and this machine can make it that way. Also, the milk frother is a plus as it easily whips up milk into a creamy froth to add to my coffee to make lattes. The only downside is the cost and availability of the coffee pods. They are not cheap and they are hard to find. The package includes a sampling of coffees and espressos. I looked online and at walmart.com and could not find that Walmart carries the Vertuo pods.

You do have to run three cycles of water through the machine before you use it and that takes about five minutes. It comes with 12 pods, four are Expresso,1 decaffeinated and the rest are different blends of regular coffee. In order to make a large mug of coffee you need two pods. The coffee maker makes a fast cup of coffee but the flavors did not wow me. You cannot buy the pods in the store, they have to be purchased online. So I checked out their website, regular coffee flavors are anywhere from $2 a pod to $1. The Expresso pods are .85 cents. Some flavors are limited and they are the most expensive.So a large mug of coffee will cost $4-$2 a cup. I find that to be really pricey so I might just use this for company. To clean the machine you need to buy their descaling pouch for $8.95. The pods have to be returned to the company for them to recycle,they will send you a bag to ship them back for free.

403,Mr. Coffee,"October 2, 2016",Mr. Coffee 4-Cup Steam Espresso System with Milk Frother,50620660,4,"This product features both an espresso maker, and a steamer for milk. It's a very small size, so it easily fits on a counter top, or tucks away for storage. For the price, it's a really good deal. It comes packaged nicely, and is easy to set-up. The design overall is nice, and makes the machine look more expensive than it really is. It has you run a pot full of water through the machine to help clean it out. However, it took three or four pots of water before a weird manufactured taste and smell is gone. Once it was clean, it was quite easy to use. You simply fill the machine with water, tighten the top cap, and then turn the knob to either ""brew"" or ""steam"". It takes the machine a couple of minutes to warm up, and then you get freshly brewed espresso. The espresso comes out pretty warm, but I would have preferred for it to be hot. The milk frother also works very well. It's not super fast, but once you get it going, it does very well. I do find the placement of the milk frother arm to be a bit awkward. You either need to turn the machine to the side, or have your arm at a weird angle. If the arm attached in a different spot, and was a bit further from the edge of the machine, it would make the overall design quite a lot better. The frother does work very well, and you are able to get heated milk with foam pretty quickly. The other suggestion I would make for improvement is some sort of way to display the water level in the machine. There is no way for you to tell how much water is left other than to pour more in and make sure the machine doesn't overflow. With this machine, you're not going to get perfect fancy coffee, but it does get the job done. For the price, it is a very good deal.

All the machines appear pretty much the same, so there is not a lot of features that differentiates them.  The two things that make this machine superior to other steam driven espresso/cappuccino machines in our minds are the power light and the steam generation.  It is easy to forget to turn off the machine and having a very bright power light is a plus for this machine.  The quality of the foam we can generate with this machine is also superior to other machines we have had.  We don't use the black plastic 'foam helper' and are able to produce thick foam that lasts a long time.  The length of the steam tube is a bit shorter than with other machines so we froth milk in a coffee mug...an added step.  However, the quality of the foam outweighs any negative from the length of the steam tube.  Overall, this is probably the best one we have ever used.",Best steam espresso-cappuccino maker we have used,Walmart,0

You get a nice 8oz espresso in just under 5 minutes. It is easy to clean. However, the smooth and slick design of the switch knob and water tank cap are ""extremely"" hard to turn. This might be a difficult problem for women or more mature owners such as myself. And you thought medicine bottles were hard to open?? Designers should have used a lever-type switch and put some groves into the tank cap so the user could have more leverage to open or turn. Also, the light on the side is useless even in the dark since you cannot see it unless you look straight into it. Better if the light was mounted to the front. If you are young and love your espresso's then this might be a good buy for you, otherwise I would suggest looking at other models and noting the ease of operating their tank cap and on/off switch.

437,Mr. Coffee,"February 9, 2014","Mr. Coffee Espresso Maker, Red (BVMC-ECM260R)",50753589,4,"After researching many options I bought this to replace an old Capresso 302 that had simply died. I actually liked the Capresso fine, and after approx 10 years of daily use, I felt like I got my money's worth. Among others I also looked at the equivalent new model Capresso, and would have no problem going with it. However, this Mr. Coffee Espresso Maker simply was a better balance of price/quality (its reviews were a little better.) I considered pump-driven models as well (like the De'Longhi EC155), but in addition to being at least twice as expensive it seemed to me the life of pump-driven types necessarily had to have a shorter life before breaking down. I appreciate the simplicity of the steam method. I guess I'm biased toward steam having gotten 10+ years of good (in my opinion better than Starbucks/Tullys/etc.) espresso from the Capresso 302. I've had the Mr. Coffee now for about 2 weeks, using it once or twice a day, and only now does it feel like it's starting to get broken in. When I fist got it I ran/steamed water several times through both the main part and frothing arm to thoroughly clean it. When I first did this cleaning the water looked/smelled a little odd (from the newness I guess.) Positives: - The water heating element heats the water very quickly (faster than the Capresso). Since it's also quieter than the Capresso I had to keep an eye on it so I wouldn't miss my window for frothing. - Strong steam pressure makes espresso fairly quickly. I'm able to tamp extra fine espresso grounds (Costco in-store grinder's finest grind setting) quite firmly and steam is still plenty strong enough to do the job. It's stronger steam than the Capresso ever was. - Frothing arm works well also with strong steam pressure, quickly warming cream (Side Note: I highly recommend steaming heavy whipping cream in smaller volume than milk or half-n-half. It makes an amazing tasting latte.) - Frothing arm tucks out of the way. Not a huge positive, but every little bit extra of limited counter space helps. - Styling is reasonably good/attractive The first 3 Pros are much stronger, and more in favor than the following Cons are against the unit. Cons: - On / Off / Froth knob (on left side) is very poorly shaped. Your fingers can easily slip off if you're trying to quickly switch to frothing mode. I've learned to make due with it, but for someone with a weaker grip, it could be a deal breaker. A smaller traditional style knob (like on the Capresso) would be a big improvement. - Same issue with the top/water reservoir knob, though this one isn't as impacting. - The frothing arm black/rubber attachment. This is a pretty minor quibble, because even though I didn't like it, it's not needed anyway, so I'm just keeping tucked away in a drawer. On this point, however, I must note that I only make lattes not cappuccinos so I can't attest to the quality/amount of froth you will get that you'll need if you're more of a cappuccino type. Bottom Line: For a steam espresso maker this unit does a quality/quick job, and the price is very competitive.",Does a good job of making strong expresso,Walmart,1

This is my first single cup coffee maker, I had heard that the cups from the other style couldn't be recycled and I wanted an environmentally responsible coffee pod maker. I'm happy to say the Nespresso pods are aluminum and can be recycled easily, Nespresso will happily send you a container so you can return the pods to them. I haven't tried to recycle them locally because the tops are merely pierced and the grounds are still inside, so that would probably be messy and labor intensive. This machine heats the water in about 25 seconds after you turn it on, then brews a Lungo (5 oz.) in 15 seconds, and a lot more quietly than my big 12 cup machine. You even have the ability to customize the amount of ounces of water you wish to add to make a larger serving, which I do with some of the stronger, richer pods. I really like how the cup tray folds up and the base pulls away from the machine so you can use a wider and/or taller cup. I didn't want to have to purchase cups just for this machine, and can happily continue to use my favorites. I have really enjoyed the variety of flavors in the 16 pod selection included with the machine and I will be ordering my favorites soon. Very thoughtful of them to include this with the machine. I've had no issues with the functioning of the machine and its parts, it's quite easy to fill, empty the used pod receptacle, and clean the unit.

This machine is extremely compact and takes up very little counter space. It comes with a thin manual, which reveal how to clean or rinse the machine before you get started. It also provides an energy conservation setting. Although, I have not explored this option yet. However, it is one of many awesome features this product provides.  The machine is equipped with sixteen starter capsules included so you can test the product immediately. I thoroughly enjoy this machine. I am a serious coffee drinker and the coffee included in the box has good flavor, it appears to have a gourmet quality. The taste is strong and phenomenal.  The only issue is with the labeling of each additional coffee capsule. They are color coordinated but the flavors are not specified on the capsule. There is a small folder inside the box that assigns a particular color to the strength of the coffee whether it is intense or decaf. Unfortunately, all the colors identified in the folder do not match the colors that are included in the box. Therefore, its difficult to tell what flavors I'm tasting. I would prefer the flavor of the coffee to be located on the label of the capsule.  There is light assembly required such as attaching the metal plates to the appropriate section.

First off, the box it comes in is so classy; I never thought that could be said about a box, but it is the truth. You open the box to have a sleek sliver machine right in front of you. Nothing about this machine is cheaply made, not even the drip catcher. It is all quality steel and no flimsy plastic. The maker comes out of the box with ease, enclosed is well-thought out and again, classy pamphlets and directions for use. The machine itself is slim in size and fits better on my counter than my regular coffee maker. The directions are well written and clear. Simply rinse out the water container, refill and snap back into place. They enclosed a sampler pack of pods for your use. At first I thought, how is this LITTLE thing going to give me the caffeine I need? I plopped the pod in and pressed the button for a cup of Espresso and it starts. The aroma in the air was so strong, I was praying it would taste as strong! I watched in awe and waited. It looks coffee shop quality. I am getting excited. It finishes. I blow and take a sip. Hallelujah! It has a kick to it! It is the real deal! I am instantly in love with it! The taste is amazing. The whole machine is amazing! Then I panic a little, how much are the pods in real life? I have my daughter Google it while I sip my Espresso. They are actually fairly priced and available almost anywhere. If you are a coffee lover, you must get this machine.

454,Nespresso,"November 21, 2018","Nespresso CitiZ Espresso Machine by Breville, Silver",759473431,5,"We're always looking at our budget trying to figure out what we can trim back on. One option was reducing our coffee budget, (and hopefully our waistlines), and save time every day, since running out to the local coffee shop was using a lot of our time and money. We all love espresso and my husband loves the larger lungo size, so we weren't sure if we'd be able to actually save money while getting a machine that offered both, along with lower-cost (but good!) coffees, plus enough varieties to keep us happy throughout the year. So we were really happy to find this Nespresso machine. It's quite small yet it creates drinks that taste even better than the more expensive beverages that we like at our local coffee shop. And it only takes seconds to make the espresso, which is really nice. Using the machine couldn't be easier: You just lift the chrome latch at top, insert the cartridge in, close the latch, and push either the espresso or lungo button. That's it! Right now, some of my favorite flavors Nespresso offers are the Paris blends: Macaron (sweet almond, cereal), Praliné (hazelnut, caramel) and also the Vanilio (Vanilla), Caramelito (Caramel), and Ciocattino (Chocolate).

I picked it because I have literally always wanted one but Was never willing to risk the investment in something I've never had the chance to try. I chose this particular machine because the description stated that it was the Citiz with milk. It was not. So, I'll explain that I am a “with milk” coffee drinker. This machine is a one trick pony but I gotta admit, it's a darned good trick. I have not had a plain espresso this delicious, rich, clean or completely in-bitter since I moved away from a big city that had access to excellent cafes. The very first shot out of this was absolutely spectacular. Deep, rich and utterly delicious. I debated all day today about wether to keep my trusty old espresso maker on the counter, because I can steam milk and make my favorite lattes and such with it, or if I should trade up and invest in a separate milk frother to go with this machine. Over a brilliant decaf espresso, sans milk or sugar, I decided that the Citiz wins. This is a truly superior home espresso experience that doesn't just bring espresso home, it simplifies it and improves on every other attempt out there, under $1000 anyway. In addition to the amazing flavor experience, this machine is a beautiful, simple and wonderfully compact addition to my counter. The sleek design and easy clean features make it well worth the extra money over competitors. If you've got a real espresso drinker in your house this is THE option. My only disappointment was that this is not the version that includes the milk frother. Personally, that would be a game changer for me. I'll be ordering one soon for the complete experience.",Single best espresso I've had in years!,Walmart,0

463,Cuisinart,"April 3, 2018","Cuisinart Programmable Espresso Maker, Stainless Steel",30224268,4,"I have used this machine steadily over the last 3 years or so to produce a consistently delicious cup of coffee with hot milk and sugar nearly every morning and, once in a while, a second cup in the evening. Although I did froth milk when I first got the machine to try out the feature and it worked fine, my simple daily preparation routine is to first microwave milk and sugar in my cup for 1 minute while tamping my illy ground dark roast coffee into the filter.  I have also tried the pods and they work very well too, but I prefer the hands-on feeling of tamping the grounds and I also don't have to wait idly for the milk and sugar to finish heating. I have not experienced any water leakage issues like those I read about in some reviews when I began my research to consider buying this machine.  Perhaps this is because I only remove the reservoir when cleaning and descaling the machine every three to six months as needed and instead use a water pitcher for refilling it between cleanings.  I am also very careful to properly re-seat the reservoir and check for leaks whenever I do remove it. During my research, I also remember reading some criticism that the filter design produced the 'crema' in an assisted or non-traditional fashion, however, I have sampled both espresso and cappuccino using the machine and, in my admittedly non-expert opinion, this design aspect does not appear to alter the flavor quality of the coffee produced. The only signs of wear that I have noticed to date is in one bottom inside corner of the drip tray where the finish has corroded a little.  It is not visible when the grated cover is on, so I have not yet looked into ordering a replacement.  Also, shortly after I purchased it, every once in a while I will need to jiggle the 'Manual' button a little to get the nice blue light to turn on.

This machine was well thought-out and designed to produce a very high-quality cup of coffee. One of the neatest features on this machine, and I do caution everyone to read your directions and follow them step by step, is the machine head area (this is where you will place your capsule), it's a TOTALLY automatic electrical mechanism/machine head. Do not force the lever, this is not your traditional K-cup brewer. Just gently press the lever up to open, and down to close. I almost thought this machine was either broken or not functioning properly when, after my first cup of coffee I opened the machine head and the automatic mechanism opened, dropping the capsule in the back area. This is just another awesome feature in how it automatically disposes of the capsule into a capsule container, where you can efficiently collect your used capsules for Nespresso's recycling program.  Now, this mechanism will not open until the unit is turned on/the power button is engaged, so again just follow the instructions carefully. The first step shall be a general cleaning with regular fresh water, no detergents or vinegar! My wife and I enjoyed our first cup of morning java with this superb brewer just today and it was FABULOUS! This machine produces not only the best coffee in my opinion, it also automatically froths every cup, just as good as any well-known coffee shop! Another really nice feature is the water volume programming. You can program this machine to brew 0.3/10 to 17 fluid ounces. Its easy to set-up and get started, the instructions are well written and simple to follow. You can also easily adjust the cup support for various sized cups and the water reservoir is large enough to enjoy a few delightful cups of your favorite coffee. I'd suggest for anyone serious about coffee to purchase this machine instead of those K-cups. Some highlights:  Brilliantly designed  Does not take-up much counterspace  Large water reservoir capacity   Automatically disposes the used capsules  Brews the best coffee I've had in a long time  Able to recycle the capsules through Nespresso's program Walmart by the way, in my opinion, is much better than that other place that charges a membership fee, just to ship within 2 days (all the while their priming only revenue). Walmart ships within 2 days, and with no membership charges!

The base where the coffee cup sits is adjustable. There are four slot heights that can be used. This unit also comes with 12 pods for the machine. It has 8 varying flavors of coffee and 4 expresso. My only concern with the machine is the pods. How expensive and how available are they? Not quite as available as the cups. And, no cappuccino pods. This machine also comes with a milk frother as a separate unit. I really like this. In no time at all, you can take plain milk and it will be whipped up and ready to add to your cup of joe.

I absolutely love my Nespresso. I have a Keurig and this machine produces a way better cup of coffee. In my opinion it makes the best cup of coffee for a pod based machine. The quality of coffee I'm getting is comparable to Starbucks for a fraction of the price. This bundle comes with the milk/cream frother which also gives the option of warm or cold frothed or unfrothed. The steamer/frother is very easy to use. Now if you use crappy chlorinated city water in any coffee preparation the heat will accentuate the chlorine so it's best to not use tap water with machines like these. I love that I can make both Italian coffee and espresso just by putting what capsule size you want in. The coffee and espresso are at the correct temperature. The machine is simple and elegant in style. The technology of the machine reading the code on each capsule gives the perfect Italian coffee with crema or espresso every time. There are preset amounts of water but there is also a way for the user to determine more or less water and the machine will remember this setting until it is changed. There is little to no cleanup, the machine cleans itself and the pods are neatly dropped into the receptacle in the back for easy cleanup and the lid to the machine needs no effort to open as it is on a lever system that only requires the lightest of touch to open or close. The Nespresso coffee and espresso in the capsules are high quality coffee. I enjoyed the sampler provided with this bundle.

It seems to be well made and comes with everything to get you started. This particular version also came with the milk frother, which is a completely separate attachment all on it's own. So you can decide whether you want to pull it out and use it or not. This could be both an inconvenience or not, being that you have to use two separate components to make one espresso. The machine is primarily made of plastic which makes it look a little cheap in my opinion, but seems well made nonetheless. The top is motorized, you push the lever and the motor opens up to put your pod in. The assortment they sent along with the machine was a really nice assortment. They're like little beautifully colored space ships. If really was quite pretty. So you add in your pod and the machine reads the pod and knows exactly how much water to dispense. The pods that came with it are coffees and espresso. So they dish out different amounts of water based on the pod. You just push the button on the top and you're good to go. If youd like your espresso a little on the lighter side, feel free to push the button again and it'll go through once more. The pods are not extremely expensive to replace which is great for those that drink a lot. My ONLY gripe about this machine is that they ONLY have pods for espresso and coffee. I understand why and I get the concept. But I really wish it was an all in one machine and that they would make pods for tea and hot chocolate as well.

I cleaned the water holder and milk frother. The water holder can be moved according to your setup. It has a cup holder that you can move up and down very easily. First you need to run a cleanup cycle that that took me about 8 minutes. You put water in water holder and press the button on top three times and when the orange light comes up it self cleanse itself. After that it's ready to use you press button down and it opens it self up put pod in and press the button again. press the button on top.and it will start making your coffee.

I hated that I had to read an instruction manual simply to get a cup of coffee at first, but I comforted myself with the knowledge that the cup of coffee would be worth it if I followed the steps in the book. I went through the process of washing all the removable parts in warm, sudsy water and drying them well. Then I proceeded with the initial cleaning of the machine itself filling the reservoir with good drinking water (I only use filtered for this), tapping the power button three times quick and then letting it cycle through a few times with no pod inside. Finally I was ready for my first cup. The pods for the VertuoPlus are attractive, but not that easy to find. Its either the Nespresso website or Amazon. You won't find these in your local Walmart. At least not yet. And they are pricey—anywhere from 85 cents to $1.25 for limited editions. This better be one rockin' cup of coffee. The machine got up to speed and out came pure, dark caffeinated heaven. Deep and rich on the bottom with a beautiful caramel colored crema on top. The first pod I used from the samples was on the strong side. I ended up adding a lot of hot milk and foam that I brewed up in the Aeroccino milk frother that accompanies this particular model. The next time I tried a slightly lighter blend and my hate disintegrated completely. This was it. Now I got why people were raving about this machine. I'm no coffee connoisseur, but this seems about as close to barista-style coffee as anyone could make at home. And even at $1.25 a cup, still way cheaper than those well-known coffee houses. Besides the coffee, what else did I like about this machine? The one button ease, you can program in different cup sizes if you don't like the three pre-programmed options, the way the used pods are automatically deposited into a container inside the machine for disposal later and the small footprint. What would I change? I wish the water tank was actually part of the machine and not an extension of it. It can be knocked over far too easily and I don't find its ability to be positioned left, right or at the back all that handy. Also the high gloss plastic body makes what I consider a pricey appliance look cheap. It could use some chrome accents. Something to give it a more weighty, sturdy look. I'm also not a fan of the submarine gray color. It sticks out like a sore thumb on the counter.

When opened it's a little exciting in a strange way since it opens in a soft and slow way creating a sense of ease to the process. The Breville came with a box of sample coffee and espresso to try. Honestly, the box is designed in such a beautifully yummy way that I felt like I was opening a box of expensive chocolates. Then when opened, it looked like a box of expensive chocolates to choose from. The pods are in shimmering circular shapes and layed out in straight rows. The lid gives a nice description of the color pod you want to try. Most of the box was coffee with two decaf pods and a row of espresso. I started with the shiny, pearl-like pink pod. My cup of coffee was complete in a matter of seconds. As the coffee exits the spout, it appears creamy. I had never seen coffee come out in that way before and it looked delicious. Once the coffee was complete, it did have a creamy top layer like I had just ordered a ten dollar cup of coffee from some high-end cafe. This was all before I decided to add steamed, frothed milk to the cup. Overall, this is a good looking, fun single-serve coffee/espresso machine. The pods are unique and exciting to try all the different flavors. The machine comes with an easy-to-read foldout to help with re-ordering pods when you're ready to add more unique flavors to your morning routine.",Perfectly Stylish and Good Quality Machine,Walmart,0

I've always wanted a home espresso maker, but I always found them to be overpriced and complicated. So like most people, I settled for a basic coffee maker and left more sophisticated drinks to my local baristas. I jumped at the chance to try this, and I'm glad I did. This machine was elegant and simplistic. It took any and all guesswork out of making my favorite espresso drinks. And most importantly it made great espresso. The setup and instructions were quick and easy to follow. Just wash the water tank, plug it in, and that's it. The machine uses espresso filled pods that drop into the top of the machine and dump into a container inside the machine when you're done. So there's no messy espresso powder or beans to deal with. I love that the milk warmer/frother is an optional attachment because not everyone will want to use it. So for those who don't need that feature, it will not take up space on there countertop or be wasted money. The machine I've noticed is not as quiet as my coffee maker. It does vibrate some when the espresso is being made. However, it's not that bad. I really like this machine.

I was super excited to try the Espressotoria and it did not disappoint. I must admit, the directions including warnings were a little intimidating at first but I soon overcame my fears by going to the Caprista website where I found a simple demonstration. The machine itself has a modern, sleek black design and stands approx 1 foot tall making it very counter top friendly. The machine has a 1 year warranty so that card is included in the box along with a quick start guide, a maintenance checklist and a recipe card showing several delicious drinks. The machine uses coffee capsules similar to K cups but much smaller. Several of the recipes called for 2 coffee capsules which personally would be too strong for my taste. I am looking forward to trying "" affogoto"" which is made by pouring 1 shot of espresso over 2 small scoops of ice cream. To make the coffee, I primed the machine as suggested and then inserted the coffee capsule. This process is very easy as you need to simply just drop the capsule in the machine and like magic the machine positions the capsule the correct way for you. I simply moved the lever as directed and pressed the button. Done!, simple and delicious. I highly recommend this machine for it's genuine taste to enjoy at home. One last thing I would like to add is it's important to keep the machine clean which is the purpose of the warnings in the instructions.

This awesome milk frother gets its power directly from the coffeemaker by plugging into the side of the machine. It comes with an instruction manual and set-up is so quick and easy. The product consists of a base (which plugs into the coffeemaker) milk container with a lid, and a stirring insert equipped with a magnetic holder and frothing coil. The inside of the milk container is marked with maximum levels for the milk and it can be frothed either hot or cold. According to the instruction manual, you can even make hot cocoa using milk soluble cocoa powder and using the stirring insert without the frothing coil. I have not tested the hot cocoa feature. This little appliance is so easy to use, really whips the foam beautifully, and clean-up is a breeze. I recommend checking-out the company's website at www.espressotoria.com, where you can watch short videos on every aspect of the coffee-making process using this system. I would suggest starting the frothing process before dispensing the coffee into your cup, as the process will take a couple of minutes. For coffeehouse-style beverages, you simply can't go wrong with this system and it will pay for itself very quickly when you consider the cost of coffeehouse beverages.

I like it and I'm going to have fun experimenting with it. This is my first time using it so I'm new at it but I would still recommend it. There's two lines on the inside of it  where you fill your milk up to it. You can even add cocoa powder to it. It just says to use milk soluble cocoa  powder because if you use any other kind of cocoa powder your milk frother can become blocked. To make your cocoa you froth your milk as the directions say and after about a minute you put in your cocoa powder.  However much cocoa you like. There's not a limit to use the cocoa powder but there is a limit to how much milk you can use in the Milk Frother. If you want to froth your milk you have to fit the coil  to the stirring insert. If you just want to heat your milk the stirring head is used without the coil. For frothing you feel your milk to the lower max line inside your milk frother. For just heating your milk you fill your milk frother up to the higher max line, then put the lid on. Push the on and off switch on your milk frother.  The red light means it's heating up and stirring the milk top. In the book it says there's a blue light which I never saw the blue light ever pop on my milk frother when I was warming up my milk and then it will shut off, stop when it is done. For cold frothing you press the on and off switch twice. Thank you Walmart spark review this is going to be so much fun.  Here's a couple picture.",Expressotoria Milk Frother,Walmart,0

Thank you! The Espressotoria Caprista espresso machine has been a wonderful delight thus far – easy to use – looks sleek and professional – EUROPEAN styling. The Espressotoria System Milk Frother is an AWESOME accessory to create either hot or cold milk froth allowing you to create a range of Starbucks quality coffees including lattes, cappuccinos, cortados, iced coffees, americanos, and more. Warms your milk a bit – and provides plenty of froth/foam – you can even probably do those fancy designs in your foam with it! The best part of the frother – besides it's pure ability to do what it promises – is that it easily plugs into the side of the Caprista machine by simlply removing a face plate off of the right bottom of the Caprista coffee brewer. No other cords – no other complicated attachments – features a small footprint too – right next to your Caprista – where you need it. Hold up to 8.45.fl.oz (250mL.) milk capacity. It has an automatic off function once the cycle is done, cleans really easily due to its easy clean non-stick interior, and has a 1 button and done function to froth your milk with a stirring head with detachable frothing coil – which is magnetically attached – for easy detachment and cleaning.

I didn't have a good first impression, for two reasons, the first was the material, I didn't like it was made out of plastic, for me it looked cheap and the second reason was the system inside to mix the milk that looked also cheap.  The reason I said all this is because I had the nesspresso one and that one was very good designed and made out of chrome stainless.  “BUT” and what is really important, after I used the Espressotoria Milk Frother , I was very impress with the result. It makes the most foamy and thick milk I ever had for my coffee at home, I really works very good.  Also it is very nice that it came with two different systems to power it.

634,Nespresso,"December 10, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville with Aeroccino Milk Frother, White",466004841,4,"I received the Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville with Aeroccino Milk Frother in white at no cost to me in exchange for my honest review of this product. I don't give an automatic good review unless the product is worthy of that. I don't recommend a product unless the product earns the recommendation.  The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville with Aeroccino Milk Frother has its good and not so good qualities. I'll start with the good. It has a sleek modern design and comes in three parts. The machine, the water tank, and the milk frother. Although there three pieces, it does not take up a large amount of counter space. There are three positions you can use for placing the water tank- left, right, or center, all behind the machine. There are also two positions you can choose from for placing the electrical cord which are left or right. I appreciated that feature because I am able to have the cord where I want it. The milk frother can be placed anywhere you choose. It is not connected to the machine and has its own cord. You can make multiple sizes of cups ranging from 0.3 Oz to 17 Oz. On the back side of the machine is a capsule storage container, however, no information is given as to if this is for full capsules or empty capsules. I did find a brief notation in the user guide that once your capsule container is full of empty capsules you can contact the company and they will send you a recycling bag to mail the empty capsules back to them so based on that I assume the storage is for the empty capsules. The paperwork included with the Nespresso are an instruction booklet for the machine, an Instruction booklet for the frother, and brief pamphlet of how to use and the coffees offered. The machine is fairly easy to use. We used it on our annual farm Christmas baking weekend. The flavor of the coffee is absolutely amazing. It did take two of us reading the instructions first to be able to use the machine. It also took a phone call to customer service due to an issue of being able to open the top of the machine. Customer Service was great. A real person, no wait time, professional, and kind.  Now for the not so great points of this machine. The instruction book for the milk frother is lacking information that one needs in order to use it. On the page that shows you the parts included, it should have those labeled on that same page and not several pages later given in a description. Also, on page EN of the frother directions it states to attach the revelant whisk. Ok, how does the average user know which whisk is revelant? There should be recipe guide included and there isn't. I also looked at the website for a recipe guide and couldn't find one, but was able to find one by going to Google and typing in Nespresso recipes. There needs to be more information included in the box on what part is for what and how to make the coffees pictured if Nespresso is going to meet their stated goal of everyone being able to create the perfect  cup of coffee just like a skilled barista. Overall I do recommend the Nespresso machine, but there are a few things to keep in mind that I mentioned in my review. Also, you will need to purchase Nespresso Descaling solution for descaling the machine which will cost between $10-26 depending on where you purchase that. Coffee capsules run between $.85 to $2.00 each or can be purchased in a multipack. I will be buying the reusable capsule. A starter pack of capsules are included and was my favorite part of this. The capsules come in a box and beautiful. It's like a box of jeweled chocolates. Also one last thing to keep in mind, if you are a decaf drinker, there are not a lot of decaf capsule options available. I would suggest for decaf drinkers to purchase the reusable capsule.",Excellent Tasting Coffee,Walmart,0

I have been a Keurig coffee drinker but I love the taste and texture of the Nespresso Vertuo. Setup was a piece of cake and the variety sampler is a great way to experience the many flavors the Nespresso has to offer. (Although I do wonder why the sample pack lists 16 flavors but only includes 12 flavors. Seems like a packaging error. The description does say 12 capsules so I think it more an error with the marketing rather than they didn't give me the right amount)  The water canister is sufficiently large and easy to detach and clean.  I was pleasantly surprised when i brewed the coffee that it filled my cup and when it brewed the espresso it made the appropriate amount of espresso rather than filling my travel size coffee mug.  The top opens easily to allow for easy loading (and automatic unloading) of the Nespresso pods I have found that the brew button takes several presses to actually kick in. The Aeroccino milk frother is easy to work and did warm and froth my milk. The design was a little troubling as it is one unit and so you can't take it apart for cleaning. it does seem to be watertight so I'm not worried, but I would have thought dealing with milk I'd want to be able to completely submerge and scrub out the remnants of milk in the frother.",Great tasting coffee anywhere,Walmart,0

It has a narrow profile, which is nice because it takes up less space on the counter. It also has a nice feature where the water tank can be positioned either on the left, right or back of the machine, making it easier to adjust to your space. The Nespresso automatically ejects the used pods into a container on the back of the machine, so no messy dripping when removing. The platform that holds the cup can be adjusted up and down to accommodate tall or small cups, which also helps reduce any splashing. The appliance was well packaged and came with easy to understand directions. It also comes with a milk frother. The instructions for that part were a bit less clear, but still not difficult to figure out. This machine came with a sample box 12 pods, 4 espresso and eight coffee. I made a regular cup of coffee and also an espresso. Both were very good, with appropriate strength. I prefer my coffee a little stronger and darker, but I tried one of the medium strength pods also and it had a very balanced flavor as well. The milk can be frothed cold or warm. Both worked well, resulting in a nice light and fluffy froth. I thought the warm setting was especially good. The pods have a bar code that the machine reads and then dispenses the correct amount of water for the type of coffee/espresso chosen. It also has a feature that allows you to adjust the water level by pushing the start button a few times to add more water. It then remembers the water level you prefer and uses that each time you make that style of coffee. It can be reset to the default setting when needed.  Because the machine reads a bar code on the pods, you can only use the Nespresso pods specifically designed for this particular machine. That is a factor to consider, since the pods are a bit pricey. They are made of aluminum that can be recycled. When you order pods, you can order a free Nespresso recycle bag that, when full, can be dropped at a UPS store and sent to Nespresso for recycling. Overall, I really like this appliance. It is easy to use and nice looking addition to the kitchen. The coffee/espresso is very good and the warm milk froth adds that special touch. The cost of the special pods is something to consider when deciding on this purchase.",Very stylish coffee maker,Walmart,0

The entire design from the espresso/coffee maker, milk frother to the capsules is smart, refined, modern and sophisticated. All functions are electronic, smart technology and well thought out.  Note: Before you make your first cup be sure to prime your system; it's very easy and takes less than 5 minutes.  * Power On, Push top button (green light will cycle while heating and stay lit when ready)  * Open the cover and insert your capsule, lightly push the bar up * Close the cover, tap on the top of the bar * Tray has 5 levels of adjustments or removable for coffee mugs * Power Off, lightly push the bar down for 3 seconds and system will shut off (system has auto shut off after 9 minutes without use) The system accepts 3 capsule sizes and has auto-programmed water levels depending on the capsule, however, you can manually add more by pushing the top button and stop by pushing the button again. Additionally, from what I read you can program/set your preferred dispense levels (did not try). I certainly appreciate the complimentary taste kit; we tried a couple of capsules and were highly pleased with the flavors, taste, and quality! * Vanizi - I drink for the flavor and this particular blend is aromatic, creamy and delicious! Absolutely wonderful with a hint of hazelnut, a dash of sugar & topped with milk froth. * Intens - Strong punch with great flavors, will definitely get you on the right track, up and ready for a busy day!

The main workings are similar. Add water and load the capsule. The difference is you don't have to tell the machine which size drink you want. It reads it from the barcode on the capsule. You do have to move the cup holder/stand based on the size of the drink. That is a tad bit tedious, but not overly.

This machine is wonderful. I've typucally never been an espresso person, since my keurig couldn't make them properly and they typically cost a lot at coffee shops, but they come out perfectly and are a little bit cheaper than Starbucks and such. I've only used the milk Frother a few times but it's been a nice treat everytime I have, and a refreshing addition to my drink. Only complaint about the machine would be the capsules are a lot more money than K cups. On amazon they sell for about $1 per capsule vs 50 cents or less for k cups. But overall, if you use this machine as more of a treat, and not an everyday affair the price of the capsules shouldn't matter thst much.",Great machine,Walmart,0

The espressorita is perfect, it's compact and fits on top of my capsule drawer with the milk frother attached.  A favorite saying I've heard and like using is ""I Just Need A Little Bit Of Coffee And A Whole Lot Of Jesus!"" This is me 100%. So you can only imagine just how excited I was to receive my machine! Yes, I own a Kuerig and love it, however, my Espressotoria opens the door to so many possibilities! I am like a kid in a candy shop! My eyes are full of Hopes & Happiness! You can make the following: • Cappuccino  • Espresso • Iced Latte • Flat White • Latte • Americano • Affogato • Cortado  Extra bonus a recipe guide (nifty card) is included.  Personally, I am a fan of creamy coffees, so I lean towards the lattes and cappuccinos. I have already put my recipe card to use and had the pleasure of making/enjoying a nice latte, it was so good, perfect for a gloomy & wet day. Like happiness dancing around in my mouth.  Note: First start be sure to read the Quick Start Guide, it's very important to prime before you make your first cup.  Using your machine is very simple, fill water tank (tap water) to the max line, insert capsule of your choice and push the button of choice. The machine has 2 buttons/ sizes (small 30ml/1fl.oz) or (large 100ml/3.4fl.oz). Again, everything need to know is laid out on easy follow cards.  So, that's everything, I love my Espressotoria (new toy) and look forward to experiment/learning how to make all the different types of coffees.",Cup of Joy!,Walmart,0

657,Espressotoria,"February 19, 2018","Espressotoria Caprista Espresso Coffee Pod Machine, White",755827387,4,"I was asked to review this espresso maker along with the frother and some of the coffee pods that go with it. Separate reviews for the other items to follow. This I believe would be a nice basic espresso machine for the novice espresso drinker/maker. It is smaller than most of the espresso makers out there. The tank holds only about enough water for 2 cups of coffee, 3 cups if you make a smaller cup of coffee. But you can remove it for cleaning or to fill it, so you don't pour water on the top of the coffee maker or somewhere it doesn't belong. This was easy to set up; the instruction book (included) gave easy-to-understand instructions for initial set up and use, as well as warnings etc. Used a pod (sold separately) to make a cup of coffee. The first time, the top handle (which you lift to put in a pod) seemed to be stuck so I lifted it again and then it closed easily. Come to find out, when you lift the handle a second time, after you put the pod in without closing the handle all the way, it ejects the pod into the ejected pod holder below. So the first cup of coffee was a cup of hot water. After I realized what I had done, I retrieved the pod from the ejected pod holder, put it back in, and used the (full) pod to make the cup of coffee.  You need to hold the button to tell the machine which size cup coffee you want, so it selects the correct water level, a minimum of 3 seconds; if you don't, it will just put a little bit of water in the cup. I even held the button for 4 seconds, and only a little bit of water came out. So I would guess this takes a little bit of practice. This espresso maker also has a port where you can attach a milk frother (sold separately). A nice little machine, and I would recommend this to someone looking for an easy-to-operate, first espresso machine.",A nice beginner espresso machine,Walmart,0
658,Espressotoria,"February 20, 2018","Espressotoria Caprista Espresso Coffee Pod Machine, White",755827387,4,"I'm not sure if I'm in love with the Espressotoria Caprista Coffee Machine, (frothier and coffee capsules sold separately), yet as I've only had it for a week. I know that I like that it makes things so much simpler just dropping a coffee capsule in for separate cups of coffee and it does make really great tasting coffee but I feel that the coffee capsules are a bit pricy. They come 12 to a pack. You have to order them and no other coffee capsules work in this machine except the ones made for it specifically . I feel the company needs to have more kinds to pick from. They don't have flavored coffee capsules which is what I really like for myself. But their decaf coffee is fantastic. I can't even tell its decaf! If you are thinking to purchase this coffee machine I suggest you check out their web site first and take a look at the choices of coffee capsuals and the prices of them to make sure its right for your own budget. I do like how the machine is relatively small in size there fore does not take up to much space and it has a real nice modern look to it and it has an outlet right on the machine that you can hook the separate milk frothier right into the machine itself if you wish to purchase that separate for it. And that frothier, I must say, is the best frothier I've ever used.

I love that it's small and very simple to use. It has an on and off switch on the side. The little handle part on the top of the machine that you lift up to put the pot in, it's a little hard to lift it up and shut it down but not super hard. I made a video but it's 9 minutes long. It's too big to post on here so I'm going to try to post it on  YOUTUBE. Where you put the water in,  there is a minimum water line and a max line of how much water to put in it. When you go to make it you press one of  the buttons at the top and if it's flashing blue that means it's heating up and as soon as it stops flashing blue you will press the button again and it will start making your coffee.  On the other side of the machine there is a plug-in that you  plug the milk frother into. At the top there's two buttons and it doesn't matter which button you push to turn it on. And the part that you sit your coffee cup on, well when you take your  coffee cup off you pull it forwards and it pulls out this little drawer that the coffee pod drops into after you get done making your coffee. I recommend this. It's a little expensive.  I think it's like $99 at Walmart and higher at other places. Thank you Walmart Spark Reviewer. This is going to be so much fun to experiment with.

Thank you! The Espressotoria Caprista espresso machine has been a wonderful delight thus far – easy to use – looks sleek and professional – EUROPEAN styling. The Espressotoria Caprista is a premium coffee capsule machine that delivers cafe quality espresso at the touch of a single button – just pick small pour or tall pour! Brews an awesome cup of expresso with tons of flavor and that creama foam espresso topping – just like at those expensive fancy coffee bars. Mine came in a white finish – which looks stunning and sleek! Allows you to brew all styles of Italian coffees such as flat white's, Americano's, latte's, cortado's, iced coffee's and more once it's paired with the Espressotoria® Milk Frother (sold separately) with the integrated power dock which means no second cord for the frother – and no batteries either! Featuring a 19 bar pump pressure, the Caprista utilizes a programmable pour function (tall or short), and features an energy saver mode that shuts itself off after a bit of unused. It comes with a 1-year warranty all in a compact sleek Italian style coffee/espresso machine – think Nespresso. The Caprista also has a waste capsule to collect your used capsule pods and any excess liquid from your brewing – features 2 different levels of cup stands (low or high) both with a collection container and perforated base, as well as a water level indicator. Really easy to use after simple set up: 1. Lift gray/silver bar up, 2. Drop in Espressotoria capsule, 3. Close gray/silver bar, 4. Press long pour button on top left – OR the short pour button on the top right, 5. Wait for brewing then enjoy! Frothing – if utilized for milk – takes a bit longer – but really provides perfect results! The Espressotoria Caprista has available for separate purchase around 6 different blends of espresso/coffee capsules – from medium to dark roasts and even a decaf option that is naturally and not chemically decaffeinated!!! I can't think of an easier way to make an authentic espresso or expresso based coffee beverage at home – and it will quickly pay for itself after your first box or two of capsules.

671,Nespresso,"December 10, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville, White",460647761,5,"This coffee maker is like nothing I have ever owned or even seen at someone's house! The Nepresso Vertuoplus single-serve coffee and expression machine is pretty awesome. It uses centrifuge technology which you can hear and also see in the finished product. It's amazing to me that the machine can read the barcode on the capsule. I'll start from the beginning from receiving and using this new coffee and expresso machine. I used the quick guide to learn the basic functions and cup sizes. This machine makes expresso (1.35oz), gran lungo (5.07 oz), coffee (7.77 oz), and alto (14 oz) sizes. It comes with an instruction book, which in my opinion is needed. The step by step instructions are very clear and well written. When you first unpack your machine you are supposed to be able to turn it on, fill up the water tank, and rinse the system by pressing the button 3 times. Once the light around the button turned green I would press it, but it would flash red twice and nothing else would happen. On a good note, this helped me realize there is a troubleshooting section in the instruction book and it is very precise and helpful. The only thing I could figure out is I had to use a capsule to rinse the machine. I didn't want to waste a good flavor, so I inserted the decaf capsule and the machine worked. Once the machine produces the desired amount per capsule you open the lid and it shoots the capsule to the back into the back capsule container. I grabbed the used decaf capsule and re-used it 2 more times to rinse the machine. I love how this machine has only one button, it makes things very easy, even though this machine is high tech. When you touch the front lever upwards it electronically opens and vice versa when pressing it down. When you have a capsule inside and you open it, the capsule automatically shoots towards the back. I don't really understand this concept. I'm assuming it helps produce less of a mess. I can see where several capsules would stack up and then you could dump the container, but it still produces some dirtiness inside the container you would need to rinse. I would just prefer to grab the capsule out and throw it away, but instead this machine tosses it to the back so if you don't want to keep opened capsules in the back you would need to empty that container and rinse it each time. The used capsule container is very easy to slide out either left or right and put back in. The water container is also very easy to take out, fill up, and put back in. You can also slide it from one side to the other or straight back depending on how you want it to look or how you need it to fit in a certain area on the counter, etc. Now for the coffee... I've only tried one capsule, but it was wonderful. You insert the capsule, then the light flashes green. Once the light is a steady green (which only takes a couple of seconds) you hit the button and you hear the centrifuge technology start. The coffee seems to almost immediately start making and wow it comes out looking fancy. As shown in my pictures, the coffee is frothy, but in a good way. This machine really makes it perfect. I tasted the coffee from the pod without milk or creamer first and it was good. I don't like black coffee. These pods are really cool and the box that comes with them explains their individual tastes and what tastes will change when milk is added. I really think I will love this machine, but i looked up the cost of the pods and they aren't cheap. It did seem that I could find generic comparable pods (still not super cheap), but I'm not sure how that will work since the machine reads the barcode. Overall, if you want nice coffee or expresso I really don't think you can go wrong with this.",Pretty amazing,Walmart,0
672,Nespresso,"December 7, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by Breville, White",460647761,5,"This is the perfect addition to my coffee addiction. This machine has a very simple yet elegant design. The water tank is moveable, and helps to save space on the counter. There's a button that you push up on and the lid opens manually, and you push down and it closes automatically. Nice design. The pod even automatically dispenses when it opens back up and the used pods store in the back.  I love the idea of the pods seem to be made of aluminum and if that is true can be recycled easier. The machine comes with 12 pods in a sample pack.  Pods are comparable to the price of K-cups. They might be a bit more expensive however the coffee is very nice.  Overall I am very pleased with this machine it brews a cup of expresso to a full cup of coffee. It has an adjustable drip plate depending on the size of cup you want.

I have never seen an Espresso being made before. It was cool. It even looked like what it does in the commercials. I didn't know that it would. I thought some of that was due to it being on TV. But it isn't. It really looks like what you see on TV.  The Nespresso Machine has a ""first time cleaning"" mode. It is also for when you have not used it for a while. It is a little weird. It makes weird noises. And it takes it several minutes to start. It made me wonder whether or not it was gonna do something. But it did start and cleaned it.  One thing that is important to know, the machine is automated. You do not force the top up or down. All you have to do is touch the button and it moves on its own. Did not know this. Could not figure out how to make it move. Then I plugged it in, touched the button, and it moved all by itself. Did surprise me. I did not see anything in the instructions that said that this is how it was.  The machine comes with a variety pack of pods. It is a good start for seeing what type you may like. Or not like. It has different strengths and flavors. And some are coffee and some are espresso. And the machine has a place in the back that the pods are popped out into. Then all you have to do is dump the bin that they are in. No touching hot pods. That is nice.  The water reservoir comes off kind of hard. But that is because of the water tight seal that it has to make when put in place. Also do not turn it upside down when there is water in it. The top of it does not seal. You will spill water.  The machine is 12 3/4"" tall, 8 1/2"" deep, and 5 1/2"" wide. And is a nice color. It looks very nice.",Interesting Machine,Walmart,0

With this machine it was really no effort. Now I didn't like how many times I had to press the button to get it to work. I'm going to have to read it now to see how to adjust the cup size because to me the coffee is not quite enough for a regular coffee mug. My favorite part of this machine is that when you are done brewing your pod just open and it gets rid of the pod for you and it is ready for the next one. Flips it right into the back of the machine for later disposal. I have tried two of the pods and I liked them just with it was a bigger cup with same flavor. I find I do need to add cream to the coffee as the steam on top is almost as much as the coffee in the cup. My coworkers however found the coffee flavor to be too strong and they did not care for them and they tried the flavored ones like the vanilla.

The Breville brews a very rich and frothy cup of coffee every time. I like dark, rich, robust coffee, and this machine can make it that way. Also, the milk frother is a plus as it easily whips up milk into a creamy froth to add to my coffee to make lattes. The only downside is the cost and availability of the coffee pods. They are not cheap and they are hard to find. The package includes a sampling of coffees and espressos. I looked online and at walmart.com and could not find that Walmart carries the Vertuo pods.

I have a family member who owns this brand and loves it. I like it's futuristic look,it's not loud when brewing. You do have to run three cycles of water through the machine before you use it and that takes about five minutes. It comes with 12 pods, four are Expresso,1 decaffeinated and the rest are different blends of regular coffee. In order to make a large mug of coffee you need two pods. The coffee maker makes a fast cup of coffee but the flavors did not wow me. You cannot buy the pods in the store, they have to be purchased online. So I checked out their website, regular coffee flavors are anywhere from $2 a pod to $1. The Expresso pods are .85 cents. Some flavors are limited and they are the most expensive.So a large mug of coffee will cost $4-$2 a cup. I find that to be really pricey so I might just use this for company. To clean the machine you need to buy their descaling pouch for $8.95. The pods have to be returned to the company for them to recycle,they will send you a bag to ship them back for free. They have free shipping on all their products. The glass mug featured on the box is not included you have to buy it from their website. This machine has a one year limited warranty.

Just insert a capsule and close the lever when activated, the machine then reads the barcode on the capsule and then spins up to 7,000 rotations per minute, blending ground coffee with water and producing the most perfect delicious crema. VertuoPlus uses an intelligent extraction system that recognizes each capsule barcode. The adjustable drip tray accommodate cups of different sizes. This package includes a 12-capsule tasting pack of 4 espresso capsules and 8 regular coffee capsules. It brews five different single serve coffee cup sizes at the touch of a button depending on your coffee needs - Espresso (1.35 oz.), Double Espresso (2.7 oz.), Gran Lungo (5 oz.), Coffee (7.7 oz.) and Alto (14 oz.) It uses the Nespresso Vertuo capsules only, the large one for coffee and the small one for espresso and has a simple and convenient 1 button operation. The automatic capsule ejection holds ten used capsules and a 40-oz. water tank that moves around to accommodate different counterspaces and kitchen.

There are refillable generic pods for the old style but I have not seen any for this new style. it is fairly simple to use and the pods automatically signal the machine to fill the cup for the right volume of water.   cons of this machine to me that make it a no is the coffee is very strong and bitter to me.

There's a small stilt that comes with the machine for smaller espresso cups that can be easily removed for using a regular sized coffee cup. This machine has a very sleek design.

The water reservoir seals tightly and slides on and off with ease. The drip tray is removable for a larger mug, but due to its compact size, I think the largest size cup that will fit is about a 14 oz. ( my photo shows a 12 oz.) another plus is that you don't have to remove the pod each time you brew -it falls into a removable reservoir that looks like it can hold about 15-20 pods.

The unboxing and assembly was straightforward. It even comes 3 boxes of sample capsules!!! First the coffee machine. Once it is set up, the instructions are pretty easy to follow as long as you can make up your mind on which capsule to start with :). The fun also does not stop there, please be sure to use a transparent cup so you can actual see your picture ready coffee being made. Due to the high pressure system, the coffee actually comes out with a layer of coffer foam on top, which is pretty amazing just to look at. In my opinion, the coffee also tasted better than the coffee made by the traditional drip coffee maker. Then there is the milk frother. I have used a generic milk frother before but I can definitely say now that you can what you pay for. This frother is much better and does not burn milk with continuous use. It comes with hot and cold settings and also have two froth settings. I used the highest froth setting and the foam was very consistent and can withstand the pouring process to the coffee itself. With three more pumps of caramel, I had a custom made caramel machiato which was so much better than the one by the major chain store. And I didn't even have to get out of the door for this. My only request for improvement is cleaning of parts. While I do understand that the milk froth can't be put in the dishwasher due to its electrical components. However, I was also not able to find in the manual whether or not the water tank and frother attachments are dishwasher safety. So to be on the safe side, I am cleaning the by hand which is not preferred.

729,Nespresso,"November 9, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi, Red",312653219,5,"This coffee system (the machine and pods) makes great coffees, espressos, lattes and cappuccinos that taste just like the big store coffee places. The major difference is that those franchise coffee restaurants charge so much money per cup and I end up saving quite a bit of money by making these coffee drinks at home myself. Yes, there is an initial investment of the pods, which depending on where you buy them and the pod count, could run you easily a minimum of $50. On the Nespresso website a single pod averages $1, and an assortment pack are about the same and more. There is lots of room for you to control the costs and I enjoy the ability to buy specific flavors and at my choice of quantities on the Nespresso website, versus buying an assortment and not using half of them because I don't like the flavor as much (waste of money).  This machine is not Keurig compatible, which means K-Cups do not work for this machine. This machine takes specific pods designed for this machine. These pods are called Vertuo not Original. This machine also makes espresso shots (1.35 oz), double espresso shots (2.7 oz), a “Gran Lungo” (5 oz), what I call a regular cup size (7.77 oz), and a tall cup aka “Alto XL” (14 oz). The machine “reads” the pod and automatically knows how much to pour in your cup. Because this coffee makes its own foam it's cool to enjoy the coffee in a clear coffee glass. After all, enjoying a flavorful cup of coffee is as much of a visual experience as it is taste.  The Aeroccino Milk Frother is amazing! It froths cow's milk, soymilk, and almond milk. It didn't froth heavy whipping cream and I don't think it frothed flavored creamer either. It has two settings for the milk based on the little “whipper” inside the Aeroccino which yields more or less milk with froth when making the custom coffees (think latte versus cappuccino). It has a cold or hot froth option. I always used the hot milk froth option and it added to the flavor profile of the coffee nicely. This machine was also very easy to use and has lots of cool aspects to it. One of them is that it is self-emptying. There is a compartment in the back of the machine where the pods are automatically dropped whenever you open it to put in a fresh pod. This is super cool and convenient for when you're entertaining.  I know that Keurig just came out with something very similar, even with a frother, but it's a single serve machine. This machine is not a single serve and is a great way to end a night of entertaining or just winding down for the night. This is going to be a hit this holiday season and I look forward to making café mocha drinks with the frothed milk and adding cool frothed milk to hot cocoa for the kids!",I highly enjoy this!,Walmart,0

Even though this seems like a relatively simple feature, I find it to be pretty useful when you are brewing multiple cups of espresso.

The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi has now become our favorite coffee machine. I'm sorry to say, after a few years with the “K” brand, the Nespresso took us by surprise and won our hearts. For some unknown reason, I felt that the Nespresso brewed better coffee than the “K” brand. If you look back in the old days when we used to make coffee, we ground the coffee beans and “cook” it in our coffee pot. The grounded beans in the coffee pot percolate as it brews the coffee to a fine taste. Delonghi's Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee maker reminds me of those days – the process of grounded coffee was transformed into something pure and magical. The taste of the coffee you get from Delonghi's Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee maker is definitely extraordinary. The coffee is full bodied and the aroma – the smell of the coffee as you sip is absolutely fantastic. There are so many times that you would always go for a second cup of coffee. Delonghi's Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee Maker has always been the topic when friends and family come over. This is a machine that you can be proud of. One of the things that we noticed is that De'Longhi's Nespresso VertuoPlus uses pods or capsules instead of the K-cups. We obviously compared this to the “K” brand. I'm not exactly sure if there is a significant difference in quantity, quality, or convenience using pods. However, Delonghi's Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee Maker automatically ejects the used coffee pods when done brewing – the machine itself disposes of the coffee pods for you so you do not have to worry about leaving leftover pods. I really like this feature and I believe this is a good courtesy for the next person to use the machine. The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi also offers three cup sizes for your convenience. So there is always a good time to enjoy a great cup of coffee at home or on the go. Delonghi's Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee Maker comes with an easy-to-read instruction manual to properly care for your Nespresso machine. Nespresso's instruction manual is full of information and illustration so you do not have to worry or second guess what to do. All information about your coffee machine and other questions can be found in the instruction manual or at their website: Nespresso.com.  We had the Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi for quite some time but to be honest, we have not used the Aeroccino Milk Frother because we prefer our coffee straight and simple. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who prefer to have a fancier coffee drink but not for us. We love our brewed coffee the way it is. Finally, when you purchase the Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi it comes with 12 free pods/capsules to get you started. I believe every single one of those pods (flavors) will be an exciting tasting experience. My only concern for everybody is how easily available the Nespresso pods/capsules in all grocery stores. With the popularity of the K-cup and readily available, I do not know how convenient it is to find the Nespresso pods/capsules. So far, the place I shop offered these Nespresso pods/capsules.  Overall, we really love our Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi. I believe this is the best coffee maker available for home use. I know that every time I brew coffee from Delonghi's Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee Maker I will always get a great cup of coffee. I always brew one on the go every day. I take it to work and start my day right. I highly recommend the Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi because this is the absolutely the best coffee maker you will ever own.

It is the best thing, well, since the Keurig cups, but 100% better. I can make the best matcha tea, within a minute, from pouring the milk into the aeroccino and stirring in the matcha. This machine is fast, efficient and perfect. This aeroccino has its own set of technology that I do not understand but in just a few seconds my milk is frothy and hot. Do no overdo the milk in the frother, it doubles in size and if you are not careful, it will over flow. Also, this machine needs TLC when cleaning the aeroccino because you cannot get the bottom mechanism wet. It is a simple rinse and sponge clan then I set it upside down to dry.

I could write pages and pages of praise and my gratitude. Unfortunately, I just don't have the space to write it all in. I'm addicted to this coffee and I look forward to every cup! If I had not received this as a free product, I'd have been resistant to try it with the price tag. However, because it was a free product to review, I was more than thrilled to try it out and see just what this machine is capable of, without worry and allows me to be very thorough in inspection and testing this device. The machine and accessories are well constructed and is very durable. This machine is virtually ""stupid-proof"". It's very simple to set-up, use, and clean up. It produces coffee and espresso that beats any coffee shop here in my area. I don't state this lightly. I do not exaggerate. The water tank is very simple to fill up and cleans nicely. The coffee comes out hot and quickly. It's got some interesting noises while it brews, but don't worry it's not anything to worry about. It spins the coffee and pressurizes it in a way where it comes out frothy and creamy. With this product, I received three boxes total of their coffee sampler selection, consisting of twelve flavors. Eight flavors are the coffee and four are the espresso size capsules. I've tried every flavor included at least one time. They're all delicious and yet different. There wasn't one flavor that I strongly disliked. I really loved them all! The manuals and information booklets are well written and easy to understand. The website is simple to navigate when you need to order more. I've long been on the quest to find exceptional quality coffee with a good selection of flavor and I've found it at last, with Nespresso! I'm really grateful to have had a chance to review this product. The Aeroccino Milk Frother works really well, quick and quiet. The results were way beyond my expectations of frothy milk. Easy to clean and use for all sorts of milky-goodness to spoon on top of your coffee/espresso. (Unflavored, Skim Milk or partial Skim-Milk only!) Funny story, I asked one of my friends to try a sip of my espresso. They ended up drinking the whole thing in one gulp. Instantly they were transported to Nirvana! I don't think I've ever seen them so happy and thrilled with a cup of coffee/espresso. Now they're hooked. I use this at laest five to ten times a day. Read further for details. If you want to try some of the best of the best, this is one of them! y favorite espresso flavor is the Diavolitto and my favorite coffee flavor is the Intensio. Both very intense flavor, but not ""bitter"" or ""burnt"" tasting. Truly exceptional product. I can't stress enough how much I love this coffee/espresso machine and aeeroccino frother set! It's worth going broke for. I'd pay this price and more! I'd pay double the price for the coffee if I had to. I'm seriously hooked. This has single-handedly elevated a simple cup of coffee/espresso to the level of heavenly - such as a well-made cheesecake! This should come with a disclaimer: Warning: Extreme risk of addiction. Exercise great caution when consuming product. If you seek a new light in your life, when all seems dark and clouds of gloom, blind your path, give this thing a shot, It's changed my life. Really. I've not been much of a coffee drinker throughout my life, but when I do, I'm seriously picky when it comes to flavors and styles. Don't make the mistake of relying on experts and their advice, Grab this thing and try them out for yourself. Note: I don't really make use of the Aeroccino as much as I thought I would. The coffee is just that good! I've always liked my coffee with some sort of flavor. These choices are so great that I don't need anything but my trusty mug! Also, the color matches not only my mugs, but my kitchen too! How cool is that! I get a lot of compliments on the machine style, color, and the coffee! I have literally had to implement a new rule when visiting my place. ""If you want a cup, you buy your own capsules and bring them over!"" I can't afford everyone's coffee habit.

First of all I have owned several DeLonghi appliances in the past and always enjoyed them. I have to say that this Nespresso vertuoplus coffee and espresso machine with the milk frother is amazing!  We absolutely fell in love with this machine. There are so many different kinds of coffees to choose from. And each one gives a very specific description of the blend. Many of the coffee descriptions sound a bit exotic. There are different sized beverages that the Nespresso can make. The vibrant red color is an eye-catcher. The machine is very quick. Definitely read the directions or watch a video on the Nespresso if needed. We could not figure out how to open it up. Then after realizing you must plug the machine and first and the top will pop open easily and smoothly to insert the espresso pod. Then when the Pod is completed and brewed out it falls into this cute little container within the machine so that you don't have a bunch of trash. The frother is very quick oh my gosh. It froths about two different amounts of phone. The foam is very soft it's not thick or quote chewy. It's very delicate such as froth should be. We made the first few cups as an expresso, a latte and a cappuccino. We were having fun trying to make designs in the froth with carmel and chocolate syrups. We were watching a video on the Nespresso and learned that the pods have some sort of barcode on them so that the machine knows what to do and how to blend the water and coffee to make it perfect cup each time. We loved the size of the pods because it's a single serving. No waste. When we have the old coffee maker we could throw away half a pot or more because there was no way just to make one cup. Good size water tank so that we're not constantly having to fill up ever few cups. Takes up very little cabinet room as a whole system. The water heats up very quickly about 20 seconds or so.

741,Nespresso,"November 16, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi, Red",312653219,3,This is such a neat invention I am obsessed with it. I love that it only has a small tank as my keurig has this massive tank but only makes a cup of coffee so I always found that pointless and it just takes up more space. The lever is electric so all you have to do it hit it and it goes down or up that is so neat. The used pods go into the back when you open it to put a new one in. It is like a little garbage back there for the used pods. This thing makes an amazing latte and the milk frother that it came with will give you creamy milk in about 30 seconds. It heats the milk up to will it froths it. This came with included pods the box of pods is like a box of elegant chocolates it looks very lavish. Now the downsides the pods are kind of pricey there is no off brands so you have to buy branded. The included pods you will probably not use all because some are decaf and some expresso. I am not a expresso drink I like a cup of coffee not a shot so almost half the box of the pods are still sitting unused I actually have 3 boxes now of half empty pods because I do not use all the ones in the boxes. The machine itself is amazing I just hope the pods become less pricey in the near future. This hands down took over my keurig I never even use that anymore. I like this so much better I can not recommend it enough.,I love this so much!,Walmart,0

It's been great. I will admit it was a little confusing at first, but only because it looks kind of intimidating with the milk frother and the espresso maker. Also, I'm not a fan of the water tank being off to the side like that. The base to the water tank does swivel around, so you can keep it behind or beside it. This maker is easy enough to use. You push the button on the front to open it, insert the pod (pods were included) close the lid, and hit the button on top. The pods are different sizes depending on what you are making, so make sure and read the manual and use the appropriate cup/mug size to avoid overflow. Overall, It did work pretty well, though.

We put water in the reservoir and the “pod” in the unit and pressed the start button. Within seconds we had hot coffee coming out the unit and it was nice and frothy and rich. We used cold water in the milk frother and was very impressed with how it whipped it up. Cleanup was a snap. The unit has its own clean setting that was easy to use. We also found that you can evacuate most of the water for storage. The unit does come with a sample pack in the box with 12 different coffee pods. I was impressed with that, but found out quickly that the “pods” for the Nespresso are quite costly and I could not find any cocoa or tea pods, this was quite disappointing.

It comes with the energy saving auto shutoff timer set to 9 minutes. This can be changed up to 30 minutes. Also the espresso is 1.35 ounces and the lungo is 3.7 ounces. These can also be changed to your own specific amount of water. All these features are covered in the manual that comes with the machine. The only downside for me is the writing on the capsules that tells the name of the coffee is hard to read.,Easy to use Espresso Machine.,Walmart,0

The assorted coffee pods that came with the unit are great. Gives you a sample of several different blends to try at a time. A little louder than a regular coffee pot, but how fast it brews a cup totally outweighs any extra decibels it produces. I received this product as part of the SparkReviewer program in exchange for my honest review. I would definitely recommend this brand, both for the space saving aspect and for the quality of the coffee pods.",Favorite New Brewer,Walmart,0

So many people have said they miss their expressos when rving because their machine at home are too large for RVs. I'm not much of an expresso kinda person but my husband loves them. He'll occasionally get his fix a a super-priced joint near his work. When I saw there's a mini version I knew I had to get it for him. It is perfect for our RV. It is about the size of my regular coffee machine but slightly slimmer. The package came with samples of their coffee so we got to try it right away. There is no waiting time! He had his expresso before my cup of regular coffee had even started dripping. I tried his and it is very strong. My husband loves it. I did one for me and my three kid's from the same cup he used. Yep. It was still very strong. My husband laughed that with one little cup we all get coffee. We've been experimenting with the different flavors. Turns out we all have different tastes!

795,Nespresso,"October 26, 2018","Nespresso Inissia Espresso Machine by De'Longhi, Black",789576148,5,"The Nespresso capsules are nothing like the k-cups. Period. The coffee is just so much more superior (and the price tag does reflect that as well…). Since I drink all my coffee black, I feel like I can really give an opinion about the quality of the beans and flavors – because I taste the difference and use nothing else to mask the delicate taste of coffee. It's better than any Starbucks coffee, McDonalds (surprisingly good coffee as well), Einstein Bros Bagels, and dare I say Dutch Bros Coffee! And this machine is a great server for the coffee. It heats up quickly, easy to place capsules into, and makes a perfect cup of coffee every time, even with a bit of foam. It's so aromatic and amazing… I feel like this machine always makes the perfect temperature for brewing, which is so so SO important. My friend actually had this machine as well when I visited her in another state. Every morning, it's the first thing I do at her house when I come down in the morning. I didn't even have to ask her how to operate it, because it was just that easy. Fill the water, pop a capsule in, grab a glass, and press a button. By the time I place a piece of bread in the toaster oven, my coffee is already done. Then I'd sit quietly and peacefully with her dogs and read the newspaper… It was bliss. I have to admit that just that one cup of coffee in the morning really set my entire day. So when I saw this machine, I knew I'd love it right away. I highly recommend this machine to anyone who's a coffee lover who enjoys a bit of life of luxury, and not just to drink coffee to get caffeine, but to enjoy its taste, aroma, and depth. The machine is quick, easy to operate, low to no maintenance, perfect temperature, and makes a perfect cup of coffee. Every. Single. Time.",High quality coffee like life of luxury,Walmart,0
796,Nespresso,"October 23, 2018","Nespresso Inissia Espresso Machine by De'Longhi, Black",789576148,5,"This is an excellent little espresso machine. Bottom line, you will not be disappointed. We are big coffee drinkers but espresso always seemed to be a treat for us. I guess I just figured it was too much hassle to make it myself, maybe its just laziness, either way, this machine has changed all that. Seriously, all you do is drop one of the little pods in, close it up, and before you know it, you have the most amazing espresso ever. Now I just need some of those cute little espresso cups. If you can run a k-cup style coffee maker, you can do this. I have to mention the pods, as silly as it sounds they are the most beautiful pods ever. They come in rich jewel tones that are worthy of being able to sit on your counter. I literally put them in a glass jar next to my machine and they look like a jar of jewels. Someone was thinking there. If they are going to sit out they might as well look good. The quality of the espresso is very nice. Like I said, I think of espresso as a treat and there is no bitterness or oily after taste. It is everything you want espresso to be. The size sits well on my limited counter space. It is smaller than my coffee maker and as deep, but smaller than my Keurig. My son has threatened to steal it and take it to school with him simply because of the size. This is an awesome little machine, sturdy, sleek, easy to use, fairly quiet and it doesn't take up much space. I am very happy with it.",Awesome!,Walmart,0

Each sample coffee box included fourteen samples. The instruction booklet had clear operating instructions but did not state how to remove the used coffee pods. I had to figure that part on my own. The coffee machine measures about 12 inches deep, 9 inches tall, and 4 inches wide. I really like that it has a small footprint in my kitchen allowing for more counter space. The machine has two coffee settings; espresso and lungo. From reading the instructional booklet, I inferred that the “lungo” setting is a larger about of coffee and water. Once the machine was assembled, I followed the preparation directions and filtered water through the machine three times before using it for coffee. Then I choose the “lungo” selection on the coffee machine. The taste of the coffee is flavorful and bold. I really enjoyed it and look forward to trying the other flavors. I was excited to see a $10 coupon on my first coffee order but after reading the fine print, the $10 off applies only if you order 50 or more coffee capsules and each coffee capsule will cost at least 70 cents each. Cleaning the coffee machine requires a damp cloth and was fairly simple.

But it's not a big issue as it has the drip catcher on the front of the maker. Also it catches the used pods in the inside removable bin.

802,Nespresso,"October 19, 2018","Nespresso Inissia Espresso Machine by De'Longhi, Black",789576148,5,"The Nespresso Inissia Single Serve Espresso Machine really does make an excellent cup of coffee. It smelled wonderful, looked amazing, and tasted very flavorful, just the way I like it. If you are passionate about coffee then you will love this machine. You can make your perfect cup of coffee with pressure brewing, just like in Italy. You can make yourself a nice 1.35 ounce Espresso or a 3.71 ounce Lungo. An espresso is a concentrated form of coffee by forcing hot water through fine coffee grounds. A Lungo is a long draw espresso, it has more water than an espresso. Both are very good if you like strong coffee. The coffee capsules are very high quality coffee with a nice large variety available. There isn't any milk in the capsules, the color and foam that you see when the coffee comes out is from the forced hot water. So if you like milk with it, like I do, you'll need to add your own. All of the coffee is of excellent quality and tastes amazing. There wasn't any that I didn't like, they are all pretty darn good. This machine is small, very lightweight at 5.3 pounds, and attractive. It has a very nice power saving feature where it shuts itself off after 9 minutes of inactivity. The water tank holds about 27 ounces of water. To start the machine you just push one of the buttons to activate it, then wait for it to preheat, then hit a button to start making coffee. Amazingly my machine only took 15 seconds to preheat and it was ready to shoot out hot coffee. That quick heating feature also came in handy for a super fast cup of hot water for my oatmeal. To get started on your coffee you simply fill your water tank, do the above to get it activated, then pull the lever up to open it and put in a coffee capsule. Then pull it back down to close it. Then push either the Espresso or Lungo button to start it. Don't forget to put a cup underneath. If you set the cup on the drip tray there is only a 3 and a half inch clearance. Or you can lift the drip tray and just set the cup on the counter for a 5 and a half inch clearance. The water amount is already preset for either Espresso or Lungo. If you want more water or more coffee just press it again. But also one of my favorite features is that you can program your own water level amount. When you push either button to start it just keep holding that button down until you have the level of water you want, then let go. That will automatically set that button to fill that same water level each time. This is great when I'm in the mood for a fuller cup of coffee. The other feature I like is that when you are done with a capsule you don't have to pull it out each time. When you lift the lever to open it up again the capsule will automatically drop down into a storage container inside the machine. That container can hold around 10 capsules before you have to pull it out and dump it. That takes us to the recycling part of all this. You can get a recycling bag and recycle all of your coffee capsules. The bag holds around 200 capsules and when it's full you just drop it off at your nearest UPS drop off location. It is recommended that you descale the machine every 3 months or every 300 capsules, whichever comes first. And you can buy a descaling kit pretty cheap for easy descaling. The machine measures 4.72 inches wide, 12.64 inches long, and 9.06 inches tall. It is 19 BAR. The cord measures 30 inches long. The machine came with a manual and a box of 14 coffee capsules. Two other coffee capsule boxes were also included in my shipment but I'm not sure if those 2 come with an order or not. They might just be complimentary for this review, but expect at least one box with the machine. I researched and found out there isn't any tea or hot chocolate capsules for the machine. It basically is intended just for their high quality coffee. You can order coffee choices of Colombia, India, Ethiopia, Kenya and Brazil. Choose from rich full bodied dark roasts, light to medium roasts, some decaf, fruity lightly roasted, flavored desserts, pure origin, and more. I highly recommend this machine for anyone who loves good quality coffee in Espresso or Lungo.",This machine brings out the best in your coffee.,Walmart,0

All the parts are easily detached from the main component, no special tools needed. Making the Nespresso Inissia Espresso Machine by De'Longhi easy to maintain. There is no filter in the water reserve tank, but the tank is not very big, it holds about two and a half cups of water. The Machine also came with three boxes of coffee cartridges; however, I do not know if they come with that many in a standard purchase or if it was special for the reviewer program. There is a wide variety of coffee cartridges to choose from, even a couple of decaffeinated. The interior of the cartridge box has the names of each cartridge that is color coded, there is also a diagram showing what I believe is the “strength' or boldness taste of the corresponding cartridge. I am not a regular drinker of expresso, but I would have to say the Nespresso Inissia Espresso Machine by De'Longhi, makes one of the best cups of expresso I have ever tasted. I also love the fact that there are two cup sizes allowing you to choose the strength of your expresso. So, with its compact size, easy to use and maintain, choice of coffee strength, as well as the wide variety of coffee flavors (even decaffeinated) all make the Nespresso Inissia Espresso Machine by De'Longhi make this a great gift for everyone even yourself.

With 2 little ones, work and home... coffee, cappuccino or espressos are a must.  Start  • System comes with manual, however, I found it much easier to watch the start up video on You Tube. Additionally, the clear label on the water tank is misleading. The label gives the impression you must first descale the system and that is not the case. To my knowledge you only need to prime the spouts. Caution - Families with small curious children, keep them away! The side spout puts out extremely hot water or steam.  • Learning/Testing - I appreciate that the system comes with 2 filter sizes for single, double and pods. Test run was basic, I just wanted to learn how to use the system and properly pack the espresso. I made was a double shot espresso and my significant other seemed to enjoy it.  • Size - Nice sleek, modern design and since it's small it fits pretty much anywhere.  • Plus - The top of the machine can be used to warm a cup, just lay face down. Love the extra warmth on my hands, gives that cozy and snug sensations.  • Steamer - Using was much easier than I expected. Once 2 buttons (single/ double) lights stay lit push the steam button, put your serving cup under the side spout, ensure spout is in milk, turn the dial down and bam you have froth. Awesome! Perfect for making cocoa for the little ones, my kiddos loved it!  • Cleanup - Very easy, all parts are removable, wash with warm water & dish soap, towel dry and replace.  Love my DeLonghi Dedica EC680 and now that I'm a bit more confident, I'm looking forward to learning how to make the different types of cappuccinos and espressos!",Great Addition!,Walmart,0

First, the design of this appliance is fantastic. It's compact, sleek and makes me look like a professional! The stainless steel finish and slim design fit in any kitchen style or size. The Dedica allows you to create several different customized beverages from espresso to cappuccino. The Dedica is extremely intuitive for first time users like myself…I just followed the simple instructions and voila, I had a caramel cappuccino! It heats up very quickly too. I especially love the milk frothing feature. My husband and I live in the k-cup coffee world so this really upped our game. I'm excited to be able to offer guests something more than just a k-cup pod of coffee now, and not have to make the Starbucks run like we have in the past. Looking very forward to experimenting with other recipes on this in the near future! This is not a cheap appliance, but it's high quality.

It's super easy to clean and maintain, the manual tells you how to clean it up after each use. It takes just a minute to clean the steaming wand and toss the old grounds. It so compact, sleek and beautiful, with a teeny tiny footprint on your countertop. It's like a piece of gorgeous kitchen jewelry. You can program the machine to specify how hot you want your espresso etc.and It's very easy to adjust these settings by following the manual.

This is a really nice looking stainless steel espresso machine and it fits in well with all my other stainless steel kitchen appliances. With its sleek and compact design, it doesn't take up too much space either. The instructions are pretty simple and the control panel is pretty easy to use with its nicely illuminated buttons. It doesn't take long to brew a cup either, due to the thermoblock technology which heats up in less than 40 seconds. I really like the milk frothing feature as well; it makes my drinks even more creamy and delicious! I am always in a hurry and have to take my coffee to go, so it is nice that this espresso machine fits taller cups such as my tall travel mug. I am saving so much money now as well, since I am not going to the coffee shop every day.

Take the time to properly set up machine before making your first cup of coffee and you will be very pleased with the results. The machine is very streamlined with not many buttons however there is a cryptic code to program the functions using these few buttons. The machine communicates with you by these different buttons flashing in various sequences or by changing color: do not lose or discard owner's manual to decipher what is happening!! It's a small price to pay for having a clean looking machine with very few buttons. This is not an automatic espresso machine, which we actually like better. We enjoy the process. You will have to use pre ground espresso or grind your own whole beans in a separate grinder (not included). If you plan on frothing milk for cappuccinos, buy yourself a small stainless steel pitcher with which to do this. The height of the dispenser is not adjustable. I read if you want more Crema, bring your cup closer to where it dispenses. We are very impressed with the quality of coffee this machine makes time after the. There is no burnt taste. In addition to a stainless steel pitcher for frothing, invest in a ""knock box"" to knock the spent grounds out of the filter.

The touch buttons on top are very easy to use and understand which makes this machine one that you want to keep on your countertop. Some of the top features include:  Water heat - A big part of making a great espresso is consistent water temperature. The water goes through a tube which heats the water in seconds, not a minute or two like other espresso makers, to a consistent ~195 degrees F. However, the espresso machine stays cool to the touch.  Handle - allows for a single or double shot with easy to use pod, so you don't have to be an expert, or measure out your beans to get a good quality espresso.  Espresso Making - takes roughly 23-24 seconds, once the water is heated, to make your espresso, which is roughly the time that it takes for restaurant/industrial espresso machines, but actually fits in your kitchen.  Frother - super easy to use. Place milk in a cup (unfortunately, the metal pouring cup isn't included), get the steam ready and turn a knob. No need to tilt the cup because of the unique design, the steam comes out already tilted, no matter how you're holding your cup of milk.  This espresso machine is just a great machine and makes a great espresso, latte, cappuccino, or any type of espresso drink you want.

This DeLonghi Espresso and Cappuccino maker makes the drinks automatically, so I just press the button for the product I want and go about my morning and its ready within 30 seconds to a minute. I also love this machine because I can fit a larger coffee mug in it, if my espresso cups are dirty, or if I want to take a double shot to go. You can also make multiple cappuchinos in a row and they all come out with really rich flavor and perfect temperature.

I usually go with the pre-ground Colombian beans from Uniquely J or generic from Trader Joes, and make a cup from my french press. The grounds are strong, and yield good flavor - but I'm never quite able to achieve the same flavor as a rich, strong coffee shop flavor. Plus, I'm a latte girl - but I can never quite figure out how to froth my own milk. I usually just heat up coconut milk in the microwave (sub-optimal, because it has a tendency to separate). This machine is changing my life - satisfying all of the above and more. The machine will make any strength you want, one or two shots of espresso. It also heats up via some special titanium steaming system inside - which makes it a super efficient process. The steaming nozzle on the side is great - froths my milk to perfection (any kind I want! Not just dairy) - and self-cleans with its own steam water system. Best of all - it's saving me tons of money on those under-caffeinated impulse buys at the coffee shop on my way to work!

This machine, used daily for at least 2 cappucinos and several espressos each day, has to this point been flawless. It is easy to use, easy to maintain, and produces delightful coffee right out of the box. Setup was easy! If I were to provide one suggestion - it would be to 'sense' the presence of ground coffee (when using the bypass doser) if the user forgets to set the 'bean strength' to ground coffee - or force a strength choice - instead of automatically grinding the default dose - which then overloads the dose and causes a ""too much coffee powder"" error/fault.

885,Saeco,"April 18, 2018","saeco hd8927/47 picobaristo super automatic espresso machine, stainless steel",717711365,5,"I'm definitely not a coffee geek, but do enjoy a good espresso, café crème, and cappuccino. I've been using a Saeco Magic Deluxe since 2001, and finally decided to upgrade after replacing a boiler or some other major part on the Magic once a year. The crème that the Picobarristo serves is fantastic, milk is steamed well, and coffee is hot. I'm convinced the grinder is also better - coffee is much stronger than my Magic at the same dose settings. The machine is easy to use, and was able to adjust the volume of the cup easily. Cleaning and setup is straightforward.  One possible downside was the milk carafe wasn't dispensing milk, so I called Saeco - I got help from a knowledgeable, legit Italian who quickly diagnosed and sent me a new carafe to solve the problem. A negative turned into positive because of great customer support.  The machine does have a quirk - it will dispense coffee when the water is low and then stop at an incomplete cup. On occasion I get a partially full cup of café crème, which my Magic never did.  A few design points - I have my machine on the counter and under the upper cabinets. The way the lids for water and beans are setup you need to move the machine out from under the cabinet, and it has rubber feet which makes moving the machine awkward. I put some Teflon plastic feet under the rubber feet so it slides easier. My Magic had a rotating bottom where I could swivel the machine out when filling the hopper and water tank.  The other design point is that the water tank and bean hoppers are small compared to my Magic, as the overall machine is much smaller. I would prefer a larger machine with more capacity, but that's sort of a nitpick.  Overall, it's a great machine. The price is either cheap (compared to other models and brands) or expensive (compared to non-superautomatics), but for a superautomatic I think this is a great deal.",Nice upgrade from Magic Deluxe,Walmart,0

Cannot use more than 3 beans on preset espresso settings or you get a sour shot. Grinder is on its finest setting for every shot or I get sour or overwhelming citrus. On hot, 4 beans, and reprogrammed espresso shot I am now getting a more chocolatey espresso like I was expecting but I am only guessing at settings. This needs finer grinds and better directions to reprogram buttons. Milk is warm enough but I had to try several brands before I found 1 that didn't taste flat or burnt when making latte. Lactose free milk doesn't work with this machine, it comes out flat or burnt tasting. Regular milk works much better. Not sure I made the right decision.

Picking a drink with pictures and descriptions, and then being able to customize the volume, temperature, ratio of milk to coffee, etc.. It really makes this a powerful and easy-to-use machine. Cons: For a product in this price range there are a few annoyances that I'd be more forgiving of on a less expensive machine: (a) Yes you can choose a wide range of volumes of coffee. However, after a point the flavor suffers as you're just watering down good coffee. So the ""fix"" is to simply make multiple cups to fill up a mug to the volume you like. As a result, this machine really needs a larger water tank (or two tanks) feeding it. (b) The machine auto cleans by running fresh water through the spout every time you turn it on as well as just before it turns off. The external drip tray is not large enough to really use as the receptacle for this waste water, so you end up having to leave a coffee mug under the spout at all times which fills with dirty water from the various cleaning cycles.","For the price, it is lacking a few key features",Walmart,1

946,Home Basics,"February 1, 2018","Home Basics Espresso Maker, 2 Cups",45806861,3,"It's perfectly fine, especially for the price and knowing it's made in China.  First, the box says it makes two, 1.5oz (.47L) cups, therefore 3oz.  But, it can make up to 4oz effectively if you fill water just below the release valve.  Don't try to put more water in than that; it's a waste of effort as water will remain in the bottom.  Coffee tastes acceptable and made in less than 3 minutes on my gas stove.  I might try to drill some more holes in the stainless steel basket but it's not necessary.  Grind the coffee a little more course than for an industrial electric espresso machine--it is a stove top model after all.  Don't expect creme on top (I use Nespresso machine if I desire that.)  Second, I did have to tighten the release valve as it leaked.  Don't go crazy, just a 1/2 turn and try it til it doesn't leak.  Third, the handle gets warmer than my Moka but it's o.k., and the top lid is a bit stiff but also allows one to partially open til you know when all the water is done.  Fourth, the steel is thinner than an Italian 6-cup model I once had but that one was larger after all. Steel thickness is acceptable, and if it was thicker would take longer to heat.  The inside lip isn't exactly sharp, but one could cut their skin if pressing firm with hands that had been wet for a while (say, doing dishes).  Fifth,  I've used it 4 times on gas range without it discoloring.  But, if you are worried about that, don't buy a stove-top model.  The stainless steel does retain heat longer than aluminum when running under cold water so let it cool well before re-opening.  Sixth, I haven't tried to pry out the seal yet and not sure one could even get a replacement...easier just to buy a new pot for $8.  It does clean up o.k., and one can always use a soft bristle brush on the gasket/strainer.

I've seen other reviews that claim this doesn't make two cups. Those reviewers do not understand that when it comes to espresso, the standard cup size is ONE OUNCE. This makes up to six even though the package says four. Simply fill the bottom reservoir right up to the shoulder of the sleeve that holds the filter.  Yes, you will see a tiny bit of steam come out but you will not really lose any water. I make six ounces every time without issue.

I use it to basically produce 15-16 ozs. of Americano equivalent coffee rather than espresso.  I purchased this one because it would make close to 16 ozs of coffee in one cycle (2 measuring cups) with either the carafe provided or with a 2-cup measuring cup.  The advantage of being able to use a standard 2-cup measuring cup instead of the provided carafe is that it is so much more durable and versatile than the carafe provided.   The  2 negatives for this machine are: 1) The cord is relatively short but not a deal buster by any means, and 2) the switch is somewhat fickle in that when I select the coffee option, I sometimes get a little water leakage out of the cappuccino wand, which I hope is a matter of getting used to finding the sweet spot .

967,Brentwood,"July 27, 2017",Brentwood Espresso and Cappuccino Maker,46823702,5,"I bought this to replace my Krups machine which was leaking water from the top. Most likely because of mineral build up over the last 10 years that I couldn't remove. I waited far too long to buy a new machine because they are so expensive but when I saw this machine for only $30 with good reviews I thought I'd try it. I made my first double shot of espresso this morning with the new Brentwood. I don't use the frother on these machines ever because I have a Mr. Coffee Latte Machine that makes GREAT froth....just not strong coffee because it's a drip machine. So after I made the espresso, I poured it into the carafe with froth and then poured it into my cup. I took a sip and I swear the clouds parted and the angels sang. The latte was nice and strong! Something I hadn't had in over a year.  All is right with the world again, lol. I saw that someone said there were two cons with this machine; a short cord and the dial not being precise. The instruction book says it has a short cord for safety reasons. But at around 31 inches long, I found it to be just fine. As far as the dial, I'm not sure how one could find it a problem. You rotate it towards you all the way to brew. Between the Brew and the Off is a Pause setting. You rotate it all the back to froth.   I am very happy with this machine but based on the fact that I don't use the frother, I can't recommend this machine. But if all you want to do is make espresso without the frother, I can recommend it. It's made as well as the Krups machine, but it is made well for $30.  At that price, if it lasts a year I'd be happy.",Great price for an Espresso Machine,Walmart,25

I highly recommend this machine to anyone looking for coffee a smaller footprint and that is easy to use. Nespress knocked it out of the park with this one.",Nespresso is a winner!,Walmart,0
995,Nespresso,"October 31, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi, Cherry Red",721575515,4,This Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi is a high quality machine with high quality great tasting coffee flavors. My family and I love coffee so it's great to try so many varieties from the 12 pack Nespresso box. Our favorite is the Giornio which is a smooth rich blend. What's amazing about this coffee maker are the pods which are unique with their own bar code on the outer edge. The maker recognizes the bar code and brews blend specific. There's three different cup sizes so you can brew a small cup or larger size cup of coffee. One thing about the pods is they are expensive and from what I read you can mainly find them online that is why I gave this 4 stars. It is less expensive though than purchasing coffee or espresso at a coffee shop and this makes an excellent cup of great tasting coffee.,Great tasting coffee from Nespresso,Walmart,0
996,Nespresso,"October 26, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi, Cherry Red",721575515,5,"This is my review of the DeLonghi Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee & Espresso Single-Serve Machine in Red Firstly, it really does make a great cup of coffee. And there are so many strengths, flavors, variety, and cup sizes, which are also customizable. If you don't want the programmed size that the pod is set to, you can hold down the brew button until you reach your desired fill mark. The only thing I don't like about that feature is the machine keeps the setting until you reset the machine to factory default, which I can never remember the button configuration to do, so I keep the instruction booklet close.  It is a very high tech machine for having only one button. This one button has like 5 functions, which are determined by how many times you press the button, and pressing it in conjunction with the lever. The lever is also very cool. It took me a minute to figure out that to open the pod compartment, you only have to push up slightly and it automatically opens the rest of the way, and vice versa to close it. Another great feature is the slim design of the machine, and the water reservoir can be positioned to sit in the back, or on either side of the machine.  I definitely recommend this machine, if only to make a great cup of restaurant quality Espresso!",Awesome machine,Walmart,0

It works great! It is definitely easy to use. Is worth the price! Makes excellent coffee and espresso. The DeLonghi Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee & Espresso Single-Serve Machine has worked better for us than others we have tried in the past. It can make 3 cup sizes. The only thing that is not so great is the capsules for the machine aren't cheap. But they do taste good. But not sure tge capsules are worth the money they cost. We have found them on sale and they are not as bad. But the machine I would recommend to anyone looking for a single serve coffee and espresso machine.

1000,Nespresso,"October 21, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi, Cherry Red",721575515,5,"This is a pretty cool coffee and espresso machine to have in your kitchen. Usually I am pretty skeptical about single serve coffee machines and the capsules. I have tried so many brands of machines and so many brands of coffee capsules and they all have that distinctive plastic-y taste that even vinegar cannot get rid of. Nespresso Vertuo capsules are made entirely of foil so there is no plastic taste whatsoever. The machine comes with a box of 12 capsules - 8 coffee capsules for 8 ounce coffee serve, and 4 capsules for 1.35 ounce single espresso serve. Both drinks come out delicious. And it is so convenient that you do not have to go through all the hassle of measuring coffee from the coffee bag, making the whole pot and then not drinking all of it, or not making enough coffee. This machine makes it so simple - just stick the pod in, add water in the water container, press the button and you are done. The water container moves so you can adjust it for better placement on your kitchen counters.  The capsules are a bit too pricey in comparison with other brands, but the taste is worth it. Overall I think it is a great coffee machine and I would definitely recommend it to all coffee lovers out there.",Great coffee machine,Walmart,0
1001,Nespresso,"October 21, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi, Cherry Red",721575515,5,"The red color is perfect to match my kitchen and unlike some small appliances the red you see online is the actual red you get. The Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi was extremely easy to set up straight out of the box and I made my first cup within a few minutes. The instructions tell you to run three cups worth of hot water (no pods) to do an initial cleaning prior to making your first coffee which doesn't take long because the machine works so quickly. The water tank holds 60 ounces so you don't have to refill it as often and they designed it on a pivoting arm so you have the flexibility to position it from left, back, right or anywhere in the 180° to fit your counter space. They designed a detachable chamber that easily pops off using magnets on the back to hold your pods and the cup tray is well designed to be both adjustable and sturdy by moving it onto the desired notches for the desired height. The machine has a 25 second heat up time (seemed faster) and it gets up to 19 bars of pressure. The pod chamber operates so smoothly you can pop it open with one push of a finger. I received two boxes of 12 assorted pods and the vanilla is one of the milder ones but still tasted like a decadently rich cup of coffee. The automatic frothing action as it brews works excellent and I made sure to show it in action on one picture. The only negative of this great machine might be the cost of the pods but I already found tons of videos online showing how to refill and reuse pods to cut costs if that's an issue. Easy to use, attractive and it makes jaw dropping rich coffee.",Easy espresso and a sleek design,Walmart,0
1002,Nespresso,"October 20, 2018","Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De'Longhi, Cherry Red",721575515,5,"Okay, I really don't know where to start. I feel like I have been seriously deprived of some very important need-to-know information. Now I know why people go crazy over coffee. This machine with these serious coffee flavors have officially changed the game for me. I absolutely love it!! I'm on cup two and I just can't wait to wrap my lips around the next cup. I never really liked coffee until I tasted gourmet coffee some years ago. But I got tired of hunting for my favorite flavors in name brand discount stores. I stopped drinking coffee again until single serve machines came out with better brands of coffee. I have been enjoying coffee again since I bought my machine years ago. I got this because my most favorite coffee drink at the local coffee shop is made with espresso and I don't have an espresso machine so when I wanted it I had to buy it. I prefer to make my own coffee drinks so I thought this was the perfect opportunity to get serious about it.  The machine is sleek and looks great on my kitchen counter. The water reservoir is a decent size for the preset cup sizes and it is easy to change the cup size. I changed the cup size from the preset 7 oz to about 12 oz and the taste is not compromised. I will try the espresso when I get the needed ingredients for my favorite drink. What I really like about this machine is that when it finishes making the coffee, instead of throwing the capsule away the machine drops it in the capsule container in the back. You simply throw them away when the container is full. It opens and closes automatically with the touch of a finger and the water heats up pretty fast. The instruction manual is detailed and easy to understand, and has corresponding pictures if you need the visual help. The machine comes in a variety pack of both coffee and espresso in different flavors and different strengths of caffeine. I am currently drinking the decaf coffee and there is no compromising on the taste. The coffee comes out foamy and so smooth. If you love the actual taste of coffee and all the subtle notes it offers then you have to try this machine.",Now We're Talking Coffee!!,Walmart,0

Secondly, it came with coffee pods already (nice touch) - pop one into the pod area, push the top down and hit the green button on top and Voila! Out spurts an awesome cup of coffee! Delicious, smooth yet bold at the same time. I really enjoyed the taste. Such a difference from a typical cup of coffee - no aftertaste.

Also, the temperature of the coffee was nicely hot; it's ready to drink right out of the machine, but by the end of the cup, or if you wait a minute to drink it, the coffee is cold.

It came with 2 sample boxes, in each was 8 different coffees and 4 espressos. The flavors are very unique and fun. They have different roast levels, so some are much stronger than others. It is simple to use and there are many awesome features about the machine itself. There are different levels for the cup plate to sit at. If you are making espresso in an espresso cup, you can put the plate at a higher level, and for coffees, it can sit at one of the lower levels depending on the size of the cup. Also, once the coffee is done brewing, by simply lifting the top, the machine takes the pod out itself and shoots it into the compartment on the backside.

The Krups machine takes up a good amount of kitchen counter real estate. It is important to consider the clearance needed to open the top of the machine to add coffee. My counters have cabinets above, so if I place it under the cabinets, I have to pull the machine forward and out from under the cabinets to add the coffee beans. The Krups machine comes with a thick instruction manual, but it is hardly needed, as the machine will pretty much walk you through the steps needed for just about anything. Upon setting up the machine, the menu will walk through the initial set up of language, unit of measure, date and time, the timing of the auto-off feature, the temperature of the drinks, and the hardness of the water in your area (the welcome kit comes with a water hardness testing strip). It then prompts you to install the water filter and cleansing liquid (also included in the welcome box). Once the machine has completed its initial setup, it's ready to start making drinks. There are several options that are preset into the menu. You can make ristretto, espresso, coffee, cappuccino, caffe latte, hot milk (with or without frothing), and hot water. With each of these options, there are further customizations you can make regarding the size, ratio of coffee to milk, frothing time, heating time, and coffee strength. The customizations can be endless, whether it be different types of coffee beans (whole bean or ground), different types of milk (if so desired), and different milk heating and frothing times. It is also possible to make up to 8 different personal profiles with up to 8 different personal recipes in each profile. I love this machine and feel quite fancy using it.
